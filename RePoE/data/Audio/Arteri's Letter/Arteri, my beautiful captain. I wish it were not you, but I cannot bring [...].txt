Arteri, my beautiful captain.

I wish it were not you, but I cannot bring myself to trust any other with this most vital of tasks.

This is the only pass between the inner and outer Empire. No further exiles are to enter the inner Empire. We have material enough for our work.

Ensure that the barricade remains in place, and if any exile should somehow pass through, kill them.

I will send for you when my work is complete in Sarn.

Until we share our next night together,

Piety
