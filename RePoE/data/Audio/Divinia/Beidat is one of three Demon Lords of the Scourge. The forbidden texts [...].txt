Beidat is one of three Demon Lords of the Scourge. The forbidden texts contain very little information about him outside the collected writings of heretics and the visions of blind seers throughout history, but I do know that he and his ilk are the most 'like us,' in that they think, speak, and can communicate. K'tash and Ghorr, the other two Demon Lords, are far too unlike us to ever be capable of making a deal with someone like Lycia... or us. If it was only Beidat, we might possibly save ourselves by offering Wraeclast as a continent of slaves to serve him, but the other two can never be reasoned with.
