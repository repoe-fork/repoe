I have only seen mention of the Scourge in the most forbidden texts of my order. The High Templars kept the secret to themselves. There are demons all around us, eternally trying to enter our world. If they manage to manifest themselves here more than temporarily, they will ravage Wraeclast and consume every living thing. Needless to say, we cannot let that happen.
