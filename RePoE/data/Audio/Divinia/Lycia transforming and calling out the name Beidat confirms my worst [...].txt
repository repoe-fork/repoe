Lycia transforming and calling out the name Beidat confirms my worst fears. In my research of her occult activities, I found mention of a ravenous horde of horrific demons that exist in some other form of reality, constantly trying to reach us to consume us.

They sought means of power to resist them, should the day come that they find a way into our world... but she must have reached out to the Scourge and made a deal...
