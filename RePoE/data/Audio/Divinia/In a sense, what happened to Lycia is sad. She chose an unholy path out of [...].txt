In a sense, what happened to Lycia is sad. She chose an unholy path out of spite, knowing the Templar preachings to be riddled with fallacies. And she chose immortality out of a desire to not be forgotten, enduring centuries of isolation as a result. She is not blameless, but Beidat was the true culprit. That self-proclaimed 'archangel,' that <i>{fiend}, enticed Lycia into the deal that prolonged her life, and used her to gain a foothold in Wraeclast. I shudder to think of what will happen if he garners more power.

These ever-changing halls are still permeated with Lycia's magic. She is not gone. She still has dominion over this place. I implore you to keep exploring the Sanctum, and killing Lycia too, if you have the fortitude to. We will never know the specifics of her deal with Beidat, but if she manages to open the door to this world, the Scourge will bring horror to every living person on Wraeclast. She is truly immortal, so all we can do is delay her, but every time she is slain, you buy us time to work on a more permanent solution.
