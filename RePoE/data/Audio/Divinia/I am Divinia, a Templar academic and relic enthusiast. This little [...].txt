I am Divinia, a Templar academic and relic enthusiast. This little settlement is... quaint. Not the most respectable place, but I'm grateful that they've given me a warm welcome.

I've been waiting for a fellow explorer to make their way here. I've discovered an abandoned Templar enclave beneath the ruins of Fellshrine. Will you join me in uncovering its secrets?
