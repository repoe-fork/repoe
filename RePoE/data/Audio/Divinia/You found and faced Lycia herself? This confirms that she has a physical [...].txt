You found and faced Lycia herself? This confirms that she has a physical form â€“ I wondered if she might be some kind of spirit or dark incorporeal entity, but this is clearly not the case. If she has been experimenting with necromancy, this may not be the last we'll see of her. She could have discovered some arcane secret that grants her extended life. Face her again, Exile. Cut off her head this time!
