You've almost cleared the way to Lycia herself. I'll prepare my incantations and rituals. If you manage to reach her, I'll be attacking the energies of the black pact directly while you fight her. We don't need to find a permanent solution... if I can manage to disable the Sanctum's immortality even for just a few moments, then Lycia's death will be permanent. That's assuming you can actually defeat her, of course.
