I've heard the people here talking about you. Now, if you're going into... that madness, I have a favour to ask of you. Most of the Templars' secret archives have probably been looted or burned by now, but there's one trove only the Master Archivist and I knew about. It's hidden within my order's Ossuary. Now if you can, please go there and search for a particular tome. It's called the Mortinomicon, and supposedly contains everything the Templars know about immortality. I know you're dealing with Kitava and his cultists, but this may be just as important in the long run.
