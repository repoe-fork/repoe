I have been exploring the surrounding halls, albeit with caution. I can't put my finger on it, but there is a powerful sense that something is 'not quite right' on this floor. The way in which the crypts are positioned seems unorthodox, and the creatures I encounter are vicious and agitated. It's almost like they're guarding something... protecting something...
