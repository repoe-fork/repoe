You actually found it! I can't believe I'm holding, in my very own handsâ€”wait, what is this? It <i>{looks} like the Mortinomicon, but the text is different... the historical references are all wrong... I might sound like a madwoman, but I think you've somehow found a tome from a different possible Wraeclast! This contains vital new information... if you're willing, I'm in dire need of further assistance.
