What really excites me is the possibility of finding relics here. I mean, think of the historical and archaeological implications! We might glean true insight into ancient Templar history... a lot can be inferred from their burial practices, their scripture, their artefacts. We might even unearth the truth about why this Sanctum is here at all.
