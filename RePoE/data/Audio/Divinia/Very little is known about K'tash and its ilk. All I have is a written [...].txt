Very little is known about K'tash and its ilk. All I have is a written record from a madwoman who mysteriously disappeared from a Templar jail cell a few years ago. She said the name K'tash, and she ranted about the demons not thinking, because many don't even have heads, and that something else does the thinking for them. I shudder at the prospect of such impossible beings.
