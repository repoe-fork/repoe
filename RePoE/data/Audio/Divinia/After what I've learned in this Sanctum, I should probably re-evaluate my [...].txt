After what I've learned in this Sanctum, I should probably re-evaluate my beliefs. I think I understand Lycia's pain. If I've been lied to by the Templars about the foundations of our religion, what else am I wrong about? Perhaps Sin is not the Original Evil that he was claimed to be. I feel strange even considering such a heretical idea!
