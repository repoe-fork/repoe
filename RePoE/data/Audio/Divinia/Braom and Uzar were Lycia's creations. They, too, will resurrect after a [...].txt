Braom and Uzar were Lycia's creations. They, too, will resurrect after a time. While they're down, I'll be able to get past them into the Cathedral. There are certain rituals I want to perform over various relics and lines of power there. I've tried this many times before, but maybe it'll finally succeed... that's what I tell myself every time...
