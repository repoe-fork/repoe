The woman spoke to you again through the monstrosities you defeated? It seems as if they were her creations. She's likely experimenting with necromancy as well as lithomancy. It seems no coincidence that this is a Templar site, and necromancy is often practised by powerful Templar heretics. This woman was likely formerly a Templar, experimenting with unholy magic and delving into arcane secrets best left untouched.
