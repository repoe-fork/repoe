A woman spoke to you through Varakath? Then that means my most recent attempt at breaking the pact failed once again. Her name is Lycia, and she is the darkness at the heart of this place. If you reach the bottom, you will have to face her. Many exiles have gotten that far, but even if you manage to kill her, it doesn't matter. Just like you and me, she's immortal while she's here. If we are ever to truly defeat her, I must use the Mortinomicon's knowledge to break the black pact that makes death here impossible...
