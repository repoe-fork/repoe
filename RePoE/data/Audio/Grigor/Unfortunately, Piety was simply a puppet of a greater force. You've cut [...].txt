Unfortunately, Piety was simply a puppet of a greater force. You've cut the strings but the master remains: Dominus. 

Do you have Piety's key? No? I heard the Blackguards talk of it. It's the one key to the Sceptre of God, on the northern edge of the Blackguard encampment. Only Piety was permitted to carry it.

Dominus accessed his laboratory at the summit of the tower via a pulley system rigged to the outside wall. That way will be barred to you, and I heard of no one, not even Piety, going in or coming out of the lower levels.

If you find that key then go with care, exile. I can't imagine what's inside that tower if even Piety and Dominus feared to tread its steps.
