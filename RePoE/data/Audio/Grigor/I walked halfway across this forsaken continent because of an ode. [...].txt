I walked halfway across this forsaken continent because of an ode. <italic>{Of Jewels and Eternity}, it's called.

<italic>{For twinkled promises}
<italic>{Of jewels and eternity,}
<italic>{The Gemling Queen gave her heart}
<italic>{And body}
<italic>{To the King of Shades}
<italic>{For one more day in the sun,}
<italic>{The last day in the sun.}

That's but a portion of the full epic. "The Gemling Queen" lived, and she's the enigma behind the fall of the Ezomytes and the Eternals both. Look to the Solaris Temple to the north-east. Find the Gemling Queen's remains before Piety does... and destroy them.
