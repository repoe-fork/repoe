When you slew Utula's body, you separated his spirit from his altered flesh. This freed him to join us as a purified soul in these Halls of the Dead. We are very grateful to you for this, as he is a true hero in our eyes. He brought Karui vengeance against the Templars, and helmed a rebellion that freed our people held in bondage in Oriath. He has earned a place here in competition with the greatest of our warriors.
