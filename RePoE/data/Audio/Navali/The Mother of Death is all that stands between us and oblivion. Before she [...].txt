The Mother of Death is all that stands between us and oblivion. Before she embraced us, those that died simply ceased to be. Now, the souls of the Karui people continue on, lending their wisdom and strength to those that follow. When you slew the Beast and allowed her to awaken, you did the Karui people a great service. We will weave you into the sung tales of our heroes.
