When you slew the Beast, you ended the Slumber of the Gods. Hinekora is finally awake, and the Halls of the Dead clamour with the joyous songs of our people. You cannot possibly understand the import of this change. The greater sum of our people, countless generations of Karui warriors, have never known their goddess. I myself have only ever spoken to her in her dreams. To hear her voice is to know that every sacrifice I made for my people was justified. This is the gift that you have given us... that you have given me.
