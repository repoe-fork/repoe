You have <i>{seen} Queen Hyrri? You did battle with her? Then her soul lives on! When she did not arrive in the Halls of the Dead at the end of her life, we thought she might have chosen to wander. When we realised she was beyond even Hinekora's sight, we feared the worst. Now, we know where she is. This... Domain of Timeless Conflict... we Karui will find a way to invade it and rescue her. Then, we will lay waste to the entity that controls it, for daring to disrespect our people so grievously!
