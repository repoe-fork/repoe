Hinekora does not see the future. That is the domain of Chaos. The Mother of Death is gifted with the ability to see into the past, not very clearly, but far deeper into the murk than mortals can comprehend. Before Wraeclast, before the Lake, before the primordial molten world, before the stars themselves, Time circled upon itself into infinity. She sees not what you <i>{will} do, only what you <i>{did}, and what you shall do again... probably.
