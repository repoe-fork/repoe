Many believe that the Mother of the Moon has been off fighting a war against the Mother of the Sun for thousands of years. While Lani Hua is indeed absent, it is not to fight against her sister. The wounded souls from that war are sent to the silver palace, where Arohongui tends to them until they may rejoin the fight. Those warrior souls cry out in fear and torment as they lay in hospice. They speak not of war with Sione, but of a war with the stars themselves. They have been sworn to silence by both Sione and Lani Hua, but the feverish ones cannot help but rant. Apparently, the two sisters did go out into the night sky to wage war upon one another, but when they got there, they encountered something horrible, something that drives even the strongest warrior to madness and panic. We have not been abandoned by our two strongest gods. They are out there protecting us every single minute of every single day, and they cannot rest for even a moment.

That's what the tales say, in any case. I don't know how much of that I actually believe.
