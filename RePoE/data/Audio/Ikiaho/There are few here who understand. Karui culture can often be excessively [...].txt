There are few here who understand. Karui culture can often be excessively focused on having certain traits, such as strength or bravado. Certain duties are expected of each of us, whether or not we want to fulfill them. I died long before Rakiata, so we never met in life, but here in the Halls of the Dead, they're my closest friend. In death, I actually feel understood. For that, I can never begrudge this place.
