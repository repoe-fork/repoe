There are many fables about the end of the world, but those are just metaphors. My tribe knows how it will really happen. The Moon, in the sky above, follows a roughly oval path around us. Did you know that our world is actually shaped like the Moon? Most believe that Wraeclast is flat, because that is the obvious interpretation of what we see. However, in studying the Moon, my tribe has discovered the truth. Also, we realised that the Moon's path is not exact. Over many, <i>{many} thousands of years, it is changing slightly... toward us. We have come to understand that the world will end when the Moon comes too close and falls upon us. This is not myth. This is knowledge. What else could possibly happen when two such titanic spheres of stone crash into each other?
