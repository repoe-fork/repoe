I have always been fascinated by the pursuit of knowledge. There is a pattern underneath everything we see. This pattern preceded even the gods. If something in the world around you works a certain way, it will always work that way. If it does not, something else is happening, and you must investigate. In life, I followed these questions to the heart of the pattern, and it took me to a vast lake... but I do not remember what I found there...
