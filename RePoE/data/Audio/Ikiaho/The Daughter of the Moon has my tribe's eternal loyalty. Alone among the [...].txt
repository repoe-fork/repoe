The Daughter of the Moon has my tribe's eternal loyalty. Alone among the gods, she has no agenda of her own. The rest all seek something endlessly—whatever it was that gave each of them a divine spark—but Arohongui was born divine, and chose to aid the Karui people as much as she could. She did not ask us for loyalty, and that is why she has it.
