They never stop asking. How arrogant! Even if we remain here for ten thousand years, I will never go through the traditions with them. I will participate in the battles because I enjoy fighting, but this is <i>{their} culture. They seem unaware that I do not intend to fit their expectations. My heart warms for no one. I do not know what love is, only that it motivates others to act like fools and monsters, depending on their inclinations. Perhaps I do have a frozen heart, but that doesn't mean I feel nothing. Their words still hurt me, perhaps even more than their weapons.
