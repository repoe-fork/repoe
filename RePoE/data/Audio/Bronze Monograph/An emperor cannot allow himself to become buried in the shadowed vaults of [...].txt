An emperor cannot allow himself to become buried in the shadowed vaults of self-doubt.

Cannot allow thoughts of imagined disaster to spin about inside his mind like so many strife-splintered wheels.

An emperor navigates his way through the terrors of perplexity with his eyes set firmly on the rising sun.
