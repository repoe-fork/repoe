If you wish to do more than feed the shambling dead, you will need to grow strong. I have seen what you are capable of. You show promise, but you are a sapling, not yet shaped by the savage winds that break most. 

If you wish to stand where others fall, ensure you've collected all the seeds and follow me. I have something to show you.
