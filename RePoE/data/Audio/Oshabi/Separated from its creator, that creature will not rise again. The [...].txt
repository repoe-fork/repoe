Separated from its creator, that creature will not rise again. The collector that draws upon the bloom siphons a power that normally runs undetected through all living things on Wraeclast. The Lifeforce. It is this which brings the dead back, hungry and fearless. It is this which twists and breaks the living, because we do not know how to wield it. But that is changing.

Take the seeds you found outside and plant them in the sacred soils around the collector. We shall draw out the Lifeforce once more.
