I am Oshabi, a child of the Azmeri. I was born on Wraeclast, I have lived my whole life on Wraeclast, and I will die on Wraeclast. And when that day comes, with its blessing, I hope I will stay dead. 

We Azmeri are few, but when the land's whispers grew silent, my brothers and sisters turned their backs on me. In that, Exile, we have something in common.

I have made this long journey in search of one like yourself. You possess might and power. Though you are in no need of a job, I have one to offer you anyway. 

On your journeys, you may come across a blister in the land, within which hide seeds. Seek these seeds out, and when you do, I will seek you out.
