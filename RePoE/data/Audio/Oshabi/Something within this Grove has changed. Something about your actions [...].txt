Something within this Grove has changed. Something about your actions here... The Grove has taken notice. It beckons me.

The Lifeforce reshapes that which it touches. Adapts. Improves them. We have seen it. Wielded it. Now I must experience it for myself. I must feel the Lifeforce flow over and through me.

The Grove wills that I act as the next seed, Exile. I am to be the ultimate expression of what life can and should be. To be born anew, in Wraeclast's image. The first of my kind. And when I am complete, Exile, you shall be the second.
