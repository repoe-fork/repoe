A divine man is still a man. Those who envision themselves as golden gods soaring above mankind can never return to the humility of a pauper. He will go to the south, and he will serve his penance, but I do not doubt he will return newly absolved by his own heart. He will seek to 'help' those he considers inferior. We both understand that no good end comes of this.
