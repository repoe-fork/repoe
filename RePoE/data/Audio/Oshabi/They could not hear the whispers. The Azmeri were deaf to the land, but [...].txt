They could not hear the whispers. The Azmeri were deaf to the land, but for me. They did not understand why I took the child, why I offered her to the earth. I felt the land demand a sacrifice. And when they stopped it, that is when the land withdrew. They did not believe that it was necessary. The child's blood would feed countless others with the blessing of fertility.

The Azmeri exiled me. My name to be spoken no more. And with that, I was alone. No tribe, no whispers. 

But it was all to lead me to the Grove.
