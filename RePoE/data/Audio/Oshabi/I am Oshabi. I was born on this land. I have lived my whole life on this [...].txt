I am Oshabi. I was born on this land. I have lived my whole life on this land. I will die on this land. And when that day comes, with its blessing, I hope I will stay dead. 

We Azmeri are few, but when the land's whispers grew silent, my brothers and sisters turned their backs on me. In that, Exile, we have something in common.
