My immediate superior has many secrets, Exile. Secrets that would turn your stomach. Were I to reveal these secrets to the rest of the Syndicate I have no doubt that my 'esteemed' leader here would be relegated to a much more menial position, and you would be forced to endure far less of their company. We are killers, but not all of us are monsters.
