Splendid. Let's see what this page has to offer us... It talks of Queen Atziri. Now here's a portentous line:

<i>{She drenches her altars with the blood of those deranged enough to question her vision.}

The next piece is a real eye-crosser, but I believe it refers to a 'communion', something to do with the harvest moon? Again, Doryani seems at the heart of it.

Good, this line I can read without issue:

<i>{This will be our final night of fear, our final night of suffering.}

Sacrifice, communion, the harvest moon... an unsettling combination.
