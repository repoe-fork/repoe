It is the Karui Way to observe nature in nature. The fish without the sea is no longer a fish. It is dinner. 

The Eternals did not see it that way. An Eternal catches the fish, guts the fish, preserves the fish and places it in a box. Only then does the Eternal feel he truly understands the fish.
