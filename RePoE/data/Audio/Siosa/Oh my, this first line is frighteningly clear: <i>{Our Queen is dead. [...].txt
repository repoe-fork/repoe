Oh my, this first line is frighteningly clear:

<i>{Our Queen is dead. Doryani is dead. So many have fallen. So many have changed.}

The latter text is almost indecipherable. It practically hums with agitation. Let me see... I can make out the words "sleep", "nightmare" and... "the Beast", whatever that may be. Our historian finishes with:

<i>{We have succeeded where our forebears did not. We have failed ourselves.}

I need not imagine the fall of the Vaal. I saw the nightmare with my own eyes.
