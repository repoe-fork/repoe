I prefer not to name my <i>{akhara} in the presence of these persons of ill repute, but I can say that I am from the northern reaches of the Plains of Vastiri. My home caravan has ninety-two carts, all of which are beautifully set with colourful tapestries and shaped metal. It is a life and land unlike this one. Difficult, duty-bound, but rewarding. I will return there someday, when my duty here is at an end.

I still owe a debt to the Boss for allowing me a place here. Nashta may be dead, but I will stay here for a few more moons.
