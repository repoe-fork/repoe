This was the best end I could have wished for Nashta. I think it was what she always wanted: not to live under the heavy oppression of a rigid set of rules, but to die fighting, as a true <i>{dekhara}. In death, by standing and fighting, she has cleared her shame. She will be remembered as a woman filled with the irrepressible spirit of the warrior, one with so much aggression that she had no place in this civilised world.

I will retrieve her body. Leave me now. I have some final things to say to my sister that are not for a <i>{jingakh} to hear. Go well, my friend.
