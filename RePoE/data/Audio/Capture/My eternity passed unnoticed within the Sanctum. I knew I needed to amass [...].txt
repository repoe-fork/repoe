My eternity passed unnoticed within the Sanctum. I knew I needed to amass great power in order to harvest the will of my prey. I commanded nascent energy, raw and shapeless, and over centuries, I gave it form. I opened gateways in the wilderness of Wraeclast â€“ and even better, I managed to lure my quarry through them. Like rodents to rhoas, they were drawn into my domain... and not one has survived.
