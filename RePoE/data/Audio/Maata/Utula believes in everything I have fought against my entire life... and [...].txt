Utula believes in everything I have fought against my entire life... and my entire death. His is an ethos of violence, depravity, and anarchy. I believe the Karui deserve order, harmony, and peace. You can't live in a beautiful forest if you burn it down. I understand why Utula was given a place here, but I still think it is a step in the wrong direction.
