My fellow Karui never wanted to face the hard truth: if the Vaal wanted to wipe us out, they could have. They wouldn't even have needed to invade us, and our lauded might would have been useless. Their Empire rose to power on the back of Corruption, and those gems the Azmeri called the Tears of Maji. Corruption has a tendency to make Karui sick with a kind of... blood fever. That is the true reason our Way forbids the use of Tears of Maji.

During my life, a handful of Karui tried to implant them in their flesh. They became filled with rage and unnatural strength, and we had to put them down... then burn their bodies. Their mere proximity made others sick, too, so for every warrior that transgressed, five others gave their lives to protect the rest of us. To wipe us out, the Vaal could have simply spread the blood fever. My peacemaking, concessions, and treaties were born of that vulnerability, and I am glad I forged such a path. The Vaal Empire eventually succumbed to its own disease, and we remained.
