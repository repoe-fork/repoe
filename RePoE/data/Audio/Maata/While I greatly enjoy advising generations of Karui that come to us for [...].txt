While I greatly enjoy advising generations of Karui that come to us for wisdom, I do wonder if the Halls of the Dead are a good idea in and of themselves. Hinekora brings our souls here after we die, but where do the souls of other peoples go? Where would we have gone? We assume the alternative is oblivion, but nobody knows for certain. These unanswerable questions plague me at night, when I am trying to sleep.
