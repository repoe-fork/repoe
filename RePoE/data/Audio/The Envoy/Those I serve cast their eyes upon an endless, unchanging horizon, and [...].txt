Those I serve cast their eyes upon an endless, unchanging horizon, and have never had cause to look away. Without change, time passes like a tear in a stream. It is invisible, meaningless and insignificant to one with no beginning and no end. 

But then came the Silence, and it deafened them, and dammed the stream, and now they can see nothing else, and can hear nothing else.
