You force an intervention, Nomad. You have proved your might. You have proved your ignorance. 

The Maven is a toddler, a nymph, a hatchling that has wandered too far and made a new nest in this realm. Her progenitor nears, drawn by Silence and conflict. Were I to allow you to continue, it would arrive to find its progeny wailing and maimed. Were I to allow you to continue, you would engender wrath immeasurable. To cease and still and grow cold is far preferable to punishment without end, punishment without time.

The Maven must be protected and guarded. A mercy for you both. Savour your remaining time, I urge you. Prepare for its arrival, I urge you.
