Yes, we live in curious times indeed. A time when old stories are being birthed, mewling and puking, into our world of dirt and blood.
 
It's all a bit inspiring really, hence I've written a little something.
 
Ancient anecdotes
Now wake from their beds
Looming in our fears
Towering above our heads
Age-old lusts
And bygone greeds
Walking and wreaking
As humanity bleeds
Rivers of history
Lakes of blood
The gods stand upon us
As we cower in the mud
