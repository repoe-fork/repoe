Piety's raised Shavronne's Barricade? Not that I was likely to ever make the trip inland, but it was nice to have the dream.

Hang on a moment, got a stray thought seeking safe harbour. Piety's one to watch her own back, so she'd never cut off an escape route from possible trouble inland.

The cunning witch must be able to lower that barricade from the other side, somehow.
