Now there's a sorry tale, more miserable than any dirge I've ever heard. Nessa's gone... Wandered off into the night muttering to herself about 'dancing to his ditty'.
 
No, I didn't go after her. In truth, she was gone when I woke up the next morn. I only imagined she'd be muttering, you see, on account of the murmurings she's been making these past few weeks.
 
Always the same, about 'him' and 'his song', whoever in damnation 'he' is.
