Marvelous! Ah yes, yes, it's all here. Ahem, Act One, Scene One:

Moody, atmospheric... not as funny as I remember, but I'm sure it gets better in Act Two. Regardless, you have my thanks. Please, take something for your efforts.
 
And next time you're in town, do come and see the show. I'll leave your name at the door... if I can salvage a door from somewhere, that is.
