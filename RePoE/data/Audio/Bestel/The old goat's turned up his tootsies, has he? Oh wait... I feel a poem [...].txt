The old goat's turned up his tootsies, has he? Oh wait... I feel a poem coming on.
 
Through the bleating flock
Our exile did wade
Over hoof and horn and goat blood sprayed
Until at last an audience with Old King Billy
Or The Cloven One
Or Abberath
And other names, just as silly
"Dine with me, friend."
Old Billy did growl.
"Feed me your soul."
"Feed me it, now!"
Our exile just smiled and gutted that goat.
So that not one more soul
Would get stuffed down his old throat.
 
Honestly, you wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a good rhyme for 'goat', exile.
