Who'd have thought those bleating bastards would go and find religion, eh? Now, there's nothing quite so sure to spoil a man's appetite than an ecclesiastical debate come suppertime.

Yet this goatmen god, this Abberath, seems fair determined to mix his morsels with his spiritual enlightenments.
 
To put no finer point on it, when the goatmen find him a soft, pink human or two as divine sacrifice... he eats them. Meat, soul and all.
 
Well, that's what the legends say.
