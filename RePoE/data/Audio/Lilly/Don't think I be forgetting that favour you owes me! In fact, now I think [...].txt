You see, those blasted cultists have been plundering the refugee ships trying to escape Oriath, and if not for my incomparable skill as a sea captain, we'd have met the same fate. But now the drowned dead are washing ashore, and they ain't staying dead.

There's been a whole lot of blood, sweat and tears getting these few lucky survivors here in one piece. What sorta Captain would I be if I let them get ripped apart by walking corpses?

Wipe the Twilight Strand clean of those filthy undead bastards and I'll call us even. Might even throw in a little something extra, if you can pull it off.
