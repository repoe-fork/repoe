Now that the Brine King is nothing but crab meat, his sunken domain, the ancient city of Tsoatha, is ripe for the plundering.

Me grandaddy once dedicated a good portion of his sailing life, trying ta hunt down the location of that monolithic city. Then, while he were... otherwise indisposed, yers truly tried to follow in his gnarled footsteps, track down the Teardrop - a pearl as big as your head, carved with the clues to the city's subaquatic location.

I were this close to completing me grandfather's legacy, when those damn Templar privateers raided me ship and took off with the Teardrop, threw it in their Reliquary, here in Theopolis. As it were, now's the perfect time to retrieve that dazzling pearl.

Think you can nab it for me? I'll make it worth yer while, maybe tick it off the list of things you owe me?
