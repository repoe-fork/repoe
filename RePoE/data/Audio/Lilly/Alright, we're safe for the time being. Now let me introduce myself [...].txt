Alright, we're safe for the time being. Now let me introduce myself properly.

Lilly Roth. Yeah, I'm one of <i>{those} Roths. Some call me 'smuggler', others 'pirate', yet I prefer the sound of 'nautical entrepreneur'. Came up with that one meself.

So you come see Lilly if you need something, or even if you just fancy a good chat with a lovely lady.
