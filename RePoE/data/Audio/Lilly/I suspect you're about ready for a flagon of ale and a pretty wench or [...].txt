The great exile of Oriath, returns to a Theopolis in chaos and ends the life of a raving cannibal god... now that's a story worth the songs of many an ancient muse.

My advice, you better get while the getting's good and have yourself a holiday before Oriath or Wraeclast or whoever else has need for your unique services once more.
