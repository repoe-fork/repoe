Yeah, I <i>{knew} Tarkleigh, if you catch me drift. He's got no time for his old bunkmate these days though. Too gaga-eyed over his lost cause of a fishwife, Nessa.

Time was, Tarkleigh and I would smuggle all 'bout the coast of Oriath. Ah, good days they was. Sweet with rum, nothing but the wind and salt in our faces, freedom in our hearts... and the law on our tails.

But I could tell he were getting ready to make feet for children's stockings with me, so I cut him loose. Not a spark's chance under the ocean the dreaded Lilly Roth's gonna wind up swelling like some drowned carcass.

Still, nice to work with that bugger one more time, just for old time's sake, you know?
