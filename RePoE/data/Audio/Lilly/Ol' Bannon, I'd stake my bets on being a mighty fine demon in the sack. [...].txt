Ol' Bannon, I'd stake my bets on being a mighty fine demon in the sack. Can't go wrong with a man in uniform!

Only now, he's gone and transformed into that pesky 'God of Light'! I've gotta believe that the man is still in there somewhere, but finding my way into his bedsheets at this stage is proving more difficult than I first thought. Don't seem to be anything that'll budge him from wherever he's hiding, not even an enrapturing roll in the hay with this future pirate queen!

Seems to me that by lettin' ol' Innocence take him over completely, it's like a leech sucking the life right out of him. He's gonna lose out on all them lusty joys of this world, and that ain't something I'd ever think fondly about.
