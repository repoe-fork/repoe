Were a long time ago now, but them Privateers, took the Teardrop, threw it in the Reliquary, then took yers truly, and threw me in those goddamn slave pens. Far as I can tell, they never did work out what the Teardrop were for. Lucky me I suppose.

It were tough, but with the help of a few other undesirables, I managed to find me way out of them pens and into the Reliquary, made an attempt to burgle back what was burgled from me.

Boy, did we sure underestimate the size of them guards the Templars had on the place. Only I managed to escape unscathed. Me accomplices weren't to be so lucky... they ended up in Wraeclast, much like yerself.

Fact, I believe you may've crossed paths. Kraityn, Alira... Oak.
