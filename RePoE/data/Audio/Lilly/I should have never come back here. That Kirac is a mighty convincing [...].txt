I should have never come back here. That Kirac is a mighty convincing salesman. I spent so much of my life voyaging across the briny deep, looting and pillaging, I never thought I'd end up working as a naval officer for the Citizen Vanguard.

They're forgiving my pirating crimes in exchange for helping to build this town, as well as providing trade and transport. It'll be a quiet life, but rewarding in its own way. I'd rather be a seafarer than a footsoldier.
