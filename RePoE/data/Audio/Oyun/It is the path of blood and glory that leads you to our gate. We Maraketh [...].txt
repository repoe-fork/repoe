It is the path of blood and glory that leads you to our gate. We Maraketh understand this path, yet we fight for our tribe, our <i>{akhara}.

You fight only for yourself, care only for yourself. That is your strength. Love breeds fear. You have no such weakness, and that is why you will kill the Beast within the mountain. Lady Dialla has told me this.

She has much faith in you, Duelist. The question is... can we Maraketh share in her faith?
