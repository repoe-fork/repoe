The Maraketh once stood united under Deshret's Banner. That was before the plagues, the tempests... the corruption.

Deshret rode here with this <i>{akhara}, the Kiyato, to put an end to the Beast's curse. And upon the very threshold of the darkness she faltered.

Perhaps she saw that King Kaom had gone there before her and not returned. Or perhaps the nightmare simply overcame Deshret's seemingly indomitable courage.

Either way, she chose not to ride into the mountain, to slay the Beast. She closed and sealed the Mines and committed this <i>{akhara} to Highgate's guardianship.

The tempests, the plagues... they passed. Of their own accord, or because of Deshret's seal, we do not know.

But what I do know is this. When Deshret vowed to watch over these Mines, she simply traded one curse for another.
