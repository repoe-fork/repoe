Tasuni has been corrupted since the day he was born.

Maraketh tradition would have it that such a warped child be left upon the moonlit plain for the gods to adopt. Tasuni was not taken by the gods that night.

Such a thing has never happened before in our <i>{akhara}. Now we know why.

Tasuni is a man caught between two worlds. Our world of light, and the Beast's world of darkness. He is our scout in the black, and without him, Nightmare would remain beyond our understanding.

And an enemy you cannot know is an enemy you cannot fight.
