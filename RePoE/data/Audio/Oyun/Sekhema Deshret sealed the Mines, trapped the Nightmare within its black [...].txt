Sekhema Deshret sealed the Mines, trapped the Nightmare within its black den.

The Beast should never have been imprisoned. The Beast should have been destroyed, yet, for all her ferocity, it seemed that Deshret lacked the courage to do so.

And now, after two centuries guarding this hole in the ground, this <i>{akhara} lacks the strength. But you are not Deshret, and you are not one of us. You will succeed where we have failed.

Deshret's Banner will break the Seal and open the Mines. It was taken from her when she fell to Voll, the Brittle Emperor.

Take the stairs to the south-west, descend to the Dried Lake. You shall have no trouble finding the Brittle Emperor. You'll smell him before you see him.

Bring Deshret's Banner home, and you will be free to pass into the darkness as you wish.
