You walk to us upon the backs of the murdered. Though we are both forged upon the battlefield, we Maraketh are not like you.

We fight for survival. You fight for ambition, and that is why you will understand the Beast within the mountain better than we do. That is why you will kill it. Lady Dialla has told me this.

She has much faith in you, Shadow. The question is... can we Maraketh share in her faith?
