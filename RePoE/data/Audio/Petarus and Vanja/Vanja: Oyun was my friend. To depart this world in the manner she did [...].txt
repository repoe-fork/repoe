Vanja: Oyun was my friend. To depart this world in the manner she did is...

Petarus: ...Barbaric. And without a protector for the tribe, we're sitting ducks here. Tasuni thinks he can rule, but he is seduced by all manner of dark things.

Vanja: There is no easy fix here. I'll be awake for many nights to come.

Petarus: I'll be right beside you, my love.

Vanja: Let's not fool ourselves love. You'll be sleeping.

Petarus: In any case, it'll be time to crown a new chieftainess soon.

Vanja: Or chieftain. Tasuni is next in the bloodline. Sure, he doesn't mind breaking a few rules, but at least he's no Dominus.

Petarus: I do hope you're joking, sweets! The Maraketh are a matriarchy! The men here aren't used to being in charge. Tasuni would ruin everything the Mother stands for.

Vanja: You would have them crown Irasha?

Petarus: She's strong, stable and traditional. I don't see why she shouldn't rule.

Vanja: Because, ironically, Tasuni has the one thing that Irasha lacks.

Petarus: What's that?

Vanja: Vision.
