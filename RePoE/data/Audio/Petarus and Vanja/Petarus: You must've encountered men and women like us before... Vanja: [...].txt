Petarus: You must've encountered men and women like us before...

Vanja: Relic hunters!

Petarus: ...Ahem, Collectors of rare antiquities. Anyway, Vanja and I are the best in the business.

Vanja: And we need your help locating a particularly rare item.

Petarus: Sweets, I was working them into it...

Vanja: It's an ancient sword, belonging to the Maraketh goddess Garukhan!

Petarus: The Storm Blade some call it. A weapon carved from crystal, capable of capturing even the most powerful of storms within its rigid edge.
 
Vanja: The goddess lost it, somewhere in the eastern desert during her ancient battle against the necromancer Saresh and his undead horde.

Petarus: ...According to our research.

Vanja: Find the blade for us, and we will make it worth your while.

Petarus: We'd do this ourselves, but what with the political unrest in Highgate as of late...

Vanja: We fear leaving, lest we find the gateways barred and ourselves without a home.
