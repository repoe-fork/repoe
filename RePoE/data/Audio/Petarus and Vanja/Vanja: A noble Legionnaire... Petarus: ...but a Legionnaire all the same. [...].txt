Vanja: A noble Legionnaire... 
 
Petarus: ...but a Legionnaire all the same.
 
Vanja: Petarus and I did our research on Adus.
 
Petarus: We needed to know as much about him and his dig site as possible...
 
Vanja: ...to make sure he was worth our while.
 
Petarus: The General was an eternal commander of the Highgate Legion...
 
Vanja: He ran a mining camp up here in the mountains. The bastard was the one responsible for controlling Karui, Maraketh and Ezomyte slaves, forcing them into the black bowels of rock fissures in search of gems...
 
Petarus: ...At least he treated them fairly and as human beings.
 
Vanja: A slave is still a slave my sweets.
 
Petarus: For all his faults, the general appears to have been a good man for his time. It's a shame what happened to him... an even greater shame that by the sounds of things, he's come back.
 
Vanja: Yes, we'd advise steering clear of his old camp.
