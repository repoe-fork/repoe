Petarus: I am proud to be part of the Order. Your order, my Lord.

Vanja: And I am sorry. I should have had more Faith. I've always believed in God. It's just that, until now, I didn't think the Templar did.

Petarus: I guess sometimes it takes a miracle, something to prove that we're not on our own in this world.

Vanja: True. Thank you, Templar, for reminding me what it's like to believe. It's a luxury that I haven't been able to afford.

Petarus: Yet it's something that all of Wraeclast can have now.
