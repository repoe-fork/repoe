Petarus: We are in your debt, my Lady, and soon enough all of Wraeclast will understand the thanks it owes you.

Vanja: You're actually the first highborn woman I've ever met who <i>{deserves} to be called 'my Lady'.

Petarus: Vanja!

Vanja: It's true and she knows it. Leadership isn't about power, it's about responsibility, and this Lady took the burden from the entire world.

Petarus: Well said, Vanja!

Vanja: It'd pay for Petarus to listen to me more often, but when it comes to you, Scion, I'm glad he didn't.
