Petarus: What was that earthquake caused by? Some sort of death shudder from that volatile Beast? I've no thaumaturgical bone in my body, yet still I can sense the corruption seeping out of the cracks in that mountain. This can't be! Why would you disturb its rest?
 
Vanja: Hush now sweetie, the situation is more complex than you would first think.
 
Petarus: The Maraketh sat under the curse of the Beast for thousands of years, they had just gotten free, yet now you do... something... to bring the source of its darkness into our very presence? This is unconscionable, it's...
 
Vanja: ...the right choice. Would you rather a hostile reign of warring immortals? Our hero obviously has some kind of plan in mind. If this shift in the mountain can remove the gods from Wraeclast, then I for one am happy to be shook up a little.
 
Petarus: Well, whatever the case, at least we have each other.
 
Vanja: And we are strongest when we stand together.
