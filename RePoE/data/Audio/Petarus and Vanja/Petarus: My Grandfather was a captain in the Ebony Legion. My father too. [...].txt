Petarus: My Grandfather was a captain in the Ebony Legion. My father too. And me. Just following the path that'd been laid out for me.

Vanja: Until you met me.

Petarus: Yes, until I met the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

Vanja: Behind bars. An exile waiting to become an experiment. Not quite how I imagined meeting the man of my dreams.

Petarus: I realised then that I wasn't part of the Ebony Legion any more. I'd become a Blackguard, like every other damned legionnaire in Sarn, taking orders from a madman.

Vanja: Petarus freed me and led us here.

Petarus: I'd heard about the Maraketh from those few legionnaires who survived the assault on Highgate.

Vanja: And I talked them into harbouring us.

Petarus: Vanja can be very persuasive when she wants to be.
