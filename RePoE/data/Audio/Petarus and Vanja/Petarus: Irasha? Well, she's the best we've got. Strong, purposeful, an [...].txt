Petarus: Irasha? Well, she's the best we've got. Strong, purposeful, an honourable warrior...
 
Vanja: I think the description you're failing to provide, love, is "stick in the mud".
 
Petarus: Stick in the mud?
 
Vanja: Yes. As stubborn and serious as they come.
 
Petarus: You just don't like her because she treats you differently.
 
Vanja: Irasha is a stuck-up elitist. She refuses to see me as a woman.
 
Petarus: Oh, sweets. You're more woman to me than all of them put together.
