Petarus: I'll let Vanja take this one.

Vanja: Thank you, love. I trained in Oriath...

Petarus: As a witch! Imagine that!

Vanja: I thought I was telling this story, Petarus?

Petarus: Yes, sorry sweets.

Vanja: I learned all about the old gods. They were supposed to be our idols, beings of divinity that guided us through our mortal lives.

Petarus: But they aren't like that at all, are they love?

Vanja: Hardly. The gods're no better than we are! And nobody that is as bad as us should ever wield that much power!

Petarus: As bad as us? Speak for yourself. I'm positively delightful!

Vanja: Yes, yes, you're so sweet, they dipped you in a barrel of sugar as a babe. We know!
