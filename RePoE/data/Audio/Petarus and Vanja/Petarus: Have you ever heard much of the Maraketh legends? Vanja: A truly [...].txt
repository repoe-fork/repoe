Petarus: Have you ever heard much of the Maraketh legends?
 
Vanja: A truly unique cosmology of strange creatures, pagan gods and powerful treasures.
 
Petarus: One such story talks of a magical stone dial...
 
Vanja: A Maraketh Calendar, said to detail important events in the future of our world.
 
Petarus: General Adus, a war hero of the Empire, reported in his diaries of discovering a dial meeting that description at a dig site somewhere in the Foothills.
 
Vanja: It appears the war hero had a secret penchant for archaeologies...
 
Petarus: But the cataclysm wiped the land clean, and buried the dig site in rocks and sand. No one has been able to locate it since, nor the stone dial.
 
Vanja: Seems that with everything that's been going on of late, knowing what's due to happen in the future, could be a fairly profitable ability...
 
Petarus: We know you would never have use for such a gift...
 
Vanja: It would remove all the enjoyment out of adventure for someone like you!
 
Petarus: Yet, In times such as these, us small folk could do well with a heads up if something particularly nasty were to occur. Besides, a relic like that should sit in a museum...
 
Vanja: ...Or our collection...
 
Petarus: ...Not be lost beneath the rubble where it benefits no one.
 
Vanja: If you were to track the Calendar down for us, we would pay you handsomely, exile.
 
Petarus: Yes, we are traders of antiquities after all.
