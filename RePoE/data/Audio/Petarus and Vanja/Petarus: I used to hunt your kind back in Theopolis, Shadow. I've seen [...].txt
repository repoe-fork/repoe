Petarus: I used to hunt your kind back in Theopolis, Shadow. I've seen what you do to people, and I know why you do it.

Vanja: 'Why' stopped being a useful question the moment we set foot in Wraeclast, Petarus.

Petarus: Without the 'why', what's left?

Vanja: 'How'... to survive. Please, Shadow, ignore Petarus.
