Petarus: My lord Templar, I can't tell you how good it is to meet a man so willing and able to put the Order back on the road to Faith...

Vanja: ...oh my god, Petarus!

Petarus: Vanja!

Vanja: I've just seen too many foul deeds done in the name of Faith.

Petarus: Committed by those who talked of God while they acted for themselves.

Vanja: Fine, Petarus, fine.
