Vanja: It's Kira, she's gone mad!

Petarus: Absolutely bonkers.

Vanja: ...The whole of Highgate is in a state of disarray. There's Beast blood in the water!

Vanja: And the old gods have risen! If you want my advice, get out of Highgate...

Petarus: ...Or save us...

Vanja: ...While you still can.
