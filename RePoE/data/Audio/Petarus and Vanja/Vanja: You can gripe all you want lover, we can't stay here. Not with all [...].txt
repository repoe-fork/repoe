Vanja: You can gripe all you want lover, we can't stay here. Not with all this blood...
 
Petarus: Where do you expect us to go, Vanja? We have our whole lives here in Highgate.
 
Vanja: I don't know... west, perhaps? The Ezomyte lands. I don't care, just somewhere that has unpoisoned water...
 
Petarus: Oh, ah Beast Slayer!

Vanja: Good to see you again!
 
Petarus: Even if you have happened upon us in a rather unruly time...
 
Vanja: Shush now sweetie, there's no need to bother them with our woes.
