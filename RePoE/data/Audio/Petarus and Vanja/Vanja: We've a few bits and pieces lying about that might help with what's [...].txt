Vanja: We've a few bits and pieces lying about that might help with what's to come.

Petarus: "Bits and pieces?" I risked my neck to salvage those artefacts!

Vanja: I know, sweetie, and I really appreciate your... artefacts.

Petarus: You didn't say that when I brought them in. You said, "Is that all?"

Vanja: You'd been gone for ages!

Petarus: And you think <i>{you} could do a quicker job of it?

Vanja: Yes, if you'd let me, yes!

Petarus: No. Not for all the jewellery in the world. What if I lost you?

Vanja: Ok. I'm sorry. We have charms and regalia, sourced at great risk from some of the most dangerous places in Wraeclast. Better?

Petarus: Yes. Thank you.
