Vanja: I thought you were going to teach us how to survive, Shadow. Instead, you've given us all the chance to far more than just that. You've given us a chance to live.

Petarus: Yes... maybe I was wrong about you.

Vanja: Maybe?

Petarus: Completely and utterly wrong, and happy for it. How's that?

Vanja: Perfect.

Petarus: And what's next for you, Shadow? You've committed the greatest murder in the history of Wraeclast. How will you top that?

Vanja: He's a resourceful man, Petarus. He'll figure something out.
