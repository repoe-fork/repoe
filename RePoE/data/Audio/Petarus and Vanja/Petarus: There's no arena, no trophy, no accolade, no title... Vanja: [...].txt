Petarus: There's no arena, no trophy, no accolade, no title...

Vanja: ...no end to what Petarus could spout in your honour.

Petarus: In this case, I think it's all right to do so for a bit, don't you? We're standing in the presence of the greatest Duelist that ever lived.

Vanja: For once, I actually agree with him.

Petarus: You've done more than attain glory, Duelist. You've saved the entire bloody world!

Vanja: We needed a hero and you rose to the occasion. Thank you.
