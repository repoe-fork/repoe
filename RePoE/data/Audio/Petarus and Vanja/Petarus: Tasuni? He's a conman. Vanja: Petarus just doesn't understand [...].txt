Vanja: Petarus just doesn't understand him.

Petarus: I understand that he gets his every need catered for by talking in riddles and telling lies...

Vanja: ...the truth about the Nightmare. He makes sense of the chaos, as best he can.

Petarus: How can we possibly know whether what he's telling us is the truth or not?

Vanja: We can't. But who else is there to ask?
