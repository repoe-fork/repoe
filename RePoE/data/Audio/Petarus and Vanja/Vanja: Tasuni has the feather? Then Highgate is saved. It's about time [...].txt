Vanja: Tasuni has the feather? Then Highgate is saved. It's about time they gave the men of the tribe a chance to prove themselves. Tasuni will usher in a new dawn for the Maraketh.
 
Petarus: For all our sakes, I hope you're right, sweets.
 
Vanja: Have you not got anything between those legs of yours, my dear? One would suppose that man would like another man to rule more than he would a woman.
 
Petarus: Well one would suppose wrong then. Tasuni may benefit me simply because I was born of the same sort as he, but it's the future of this fascinating tribe that worries me - he's reckless and flippant of their sacred traditions. I fear with him at the front of their <i>{dekhara}, they will lose what makes them sacred. They will become like the bloody savages that wander the wastelands, or worse - a Blackguard!
 
Vanja: Being a Blackguard wasn't that bad, surely?
 
Petarus: ...never again.
