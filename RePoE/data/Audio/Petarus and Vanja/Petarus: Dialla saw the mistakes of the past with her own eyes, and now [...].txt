Petarus: Dialla saw the mistakes of the past with her own eyes, and now she's given everything to fix them. Right, Vanja?

Vanja: I don't know, Petarus. I saw people die for each other in Sarn. I saw clarity, resolution in their eyes. In Dialla's eyes... I see ghosts.

Petarus: Those eyes have seen horrors that we can't even imagine.

Vanja: Maybe, but this 'sacrifice' of hers? I think it was more like a <i>{deal} and Dialla didn't quite get what she'd bargained for.
