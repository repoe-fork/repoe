Petarus: It's obvious to everyone now.

Vanja: There's no one like you, Witch.

Petarus: The Beast learned that the hard way...

Vanja: ...and the whole of Wraeclast will learn about it, one way or another.

Petarus: So, I guess this is the happily-ever-after they promised us when we were kids, right, Vanja?

Vanja: For us, for Wraeclast... maybe. What about you, sister? Do you even know what that looks like for you?

Petarus: There's plenty of happiness to go around now.

Vanja: You deserve a piece of it.
