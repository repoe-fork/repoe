Vanja: You are indeed a wonder, mountain cat.

Petarus: Oh, so she's allowed to share our campfire now, is she?

Vanja: I can admit when I'm wrong.

Petarus: Sure, someone just has to save the world before you do it.

Vanja: A girl's got to have standards, Petarus.

Petarus: Well, I think it's safe to say, Vanja, that our Ranger here has managed to set a whole new standard. One that the whole of Wraeclast will need to live up to.

Vanja: I'm happy to say that I think you're right, Petarus. So utterly, wonderfully, right.
