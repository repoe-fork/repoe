Vanja: I am proud to know you, Karui.

Petarus: And I'm sorry. I should have been less hasty...

Vanja: ...bigoted?

Petarus: <i>{Quick to judge}, but, then... Wraeclast tends to bring that out in people. Quick to judge or quick to die... it's been that way for far too long.

Vanja: But thanks to our warrior here, that could all begin to change.

Petarus: Dominus is gone. The Beast is gone. Feels like we can all start again now.

Vanja: Oriathan and Karui, everyone. Thanks to you.
