From what you've found, while Vorana fought a last stand, the rest of our people here on Wraeclast attempted to escape through some ancient site of power. Uhtred was there waiting for them... and now we know what happened. He, too, fell to the corrupting madness. He must have slain them all at the threshold, though I do hope some got past him and escaped.

The question that lingers with me though: Uhtred was the one who first declared the gems unclean. He never used them, by the accounts we found. How, then, did he go mad? What did he witness that broke his mind?
