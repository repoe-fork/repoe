A grim fate descended upon our people here in Wraeclast. Part of me wants to believe that Vorana took on this entire mad continent herself, but we're here now, and monsters still abound, so I think we both know she did not win the day. But our people attempted to flee through some sort of cave? We must find out the rest!
