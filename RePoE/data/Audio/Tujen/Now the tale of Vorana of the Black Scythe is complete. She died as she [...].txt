Now the tale of Vorana of the Black Scythe is complete. She died as she lived: making war. As a descendant of Annest, Vorana's daughter, this fills a gap in the history of my lineage. When we return home, I will make sure the Kalguur know that Vorana went down in a blaze of glory, bringing a personal war against an entire continent of monsters herself.

We'll just leave out the part where she became an immortal abomination, aye?
