She was a fearsome and irrepressible warrior. King Cadigan the Third tried to mandate her service to the Crown, but she laid flat every man sent to bring her in. Eventually, he realised that she couldn't <i>{be} controlled, and he gave her a Mercenary Charter instead. Given the freedom to operate the way she wanted, she won many great victories for the Kalguur. I respect those who make their own way.

Her fate here on Wraeclast was unknown, but I have a feeling she's still kicking about. A burning spirit like that never goes down without a legendary fight.
