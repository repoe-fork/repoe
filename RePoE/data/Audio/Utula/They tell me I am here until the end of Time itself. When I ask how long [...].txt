They tell me I am here until the end of Time itself. When I ask how long that is, they all give me a different answer. I don't think any of them actually know. They console themselves with tales of endings and rebirths, but I think they're terrified of the most likely possibility. What if Time never ends at all? What if we are here <i>{forever?} That Rongokurai chieftain has been here thousands of years already, and he's gone a bit off. What happens when we've all been here for ten thousand years? A <i>{million} years? We'll be stark raving mad, and we'll <i>{never get out}, unless we unite and assault the walls of this prison directly!
