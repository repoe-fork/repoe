The Way means nothing to me. Where were my fellow Karui tribes when we prisoners were rotting in slave pens since the time of Lioneye? I guess nobody was very interested in rescuing us. What does all that strength matter if it only benefits the strong? I was born into slavery. I never had a choice. I refuse to continue being a prisoner in my own afterlife!
