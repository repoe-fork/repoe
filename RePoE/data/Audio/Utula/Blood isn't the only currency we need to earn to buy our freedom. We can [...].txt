Blood isn't the only currency we need to earn to buy our freedom. We can kill all the Templar mongrels we like out there. It won't matter a damn if we don't get inside their stronghold, the Templar Courts. Might as well put my bloody chains back on right now!

Problem is, there's some sort of witchery surrounding the place. Only those who 'see the truth with faithful eyes' are getting in there. The power of Innocence... it's all in the eyes, you see.

Yet blessed Kitava has answered my prayers and sent us just the pair of eyes we need. The ever faithful Justicar Casticus. He's there in the Control Blocks right now, smiting my people with self righteous fury.

Find him, and rip his faithful eyes out. Then I'm sure the good Justicar will be kind enough to 'see' you into the Templar Courts.
