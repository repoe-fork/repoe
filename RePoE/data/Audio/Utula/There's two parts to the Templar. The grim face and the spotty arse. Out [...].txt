There's two parts to the Templar. The grim face and the spotty arse.

Out front you've got the Templar Courts, usually the last place our <i>{hatungo} see if they're stupid enough to preach their craft within a Templar's hearing. Oriath's wood-mongers must do a roaring trade with that place. When the wind blows right, you can even smell the aroma of barbequed blasphemer from here.

The arse end, that's the Chamber of Innocence. It's where the real earnest believing gets done. Where the young Templar go to pay their respects to God almighty and get the good sense baptised out of their heads. I've not seen inside the chamber myself, but you can feel it from over a block away. Like there's an eye in your gut, peering through your insides, looking for even the tiniest stain of Sin. 

I tell you, sane people go in one end of that place, ash and apostles come out the other. Watch yourself in there.
