Lani's a pretty tough girl, for a half-blood. Her mother was Karui, but her father... a lord with a nose for island flowers.

Despite that Oriathan stain in her blood, Lani risked her life, time and time again, slipping us the information that she bore between the lords and ladies of Theopolis. Honestly couldn't have put the pieces of this uprising together without her.

And she's a fighter. Struck down two overseers before a third managed to put that scratch on her. Don't worry, it won't slow her down for long. Not Lani.
