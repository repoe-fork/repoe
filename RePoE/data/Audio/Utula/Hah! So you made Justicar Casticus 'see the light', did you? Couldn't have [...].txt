Hah! So you made Justicar Casticus 'see the light', did you? Couldn't have happened to a nicer fulla. Yet now I've an even more charming chap for you to make the acquaintance of. He's over at the Chamber of Innocence, beyond the Templar Courts, and I bet he's just dying to meet you.

It's High Templar Avarius I'm talking about, although he's so filled to the eyeballs with Innocence that it's hard to tell where the man ends and the god begins these days. That's good news for us. Kill the man and you kill the god.

And what are the Templar without their god? Lambs in a slaughterhouse.
