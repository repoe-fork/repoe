Hinekora is our jailer. I imagine she had good intentions when she made this place. Preserve the souls of the Karui so that they may guide their descendants, sure. Sounds lovely. Then, she went to sleep for thousands of years. All the souls of my people have been collecting here unattended ever since. That seems like a massive blunder. I don't care that she's awake now. She's hardly present. There's no way she's the same as she was, not after a sleep like that. We're stuck in a prison without a warden, and there is <i>{no way out.}
