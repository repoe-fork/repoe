You know what's strange? I always thought Rakiata was a man. I suppose I don't know much about my own people, beyond the remnants of knowledge the slaves passed on in Oriath's pens. Coming here, I'm furious at how much of my own history was denied me. I'm basically locked in a permanent family reunion with relatives I've never met.
