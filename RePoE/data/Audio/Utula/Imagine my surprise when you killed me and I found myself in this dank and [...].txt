Imagine my surprise when you killed me and I found myself in this dank and dour dungeon. I didn't even know about this place. I grew up in the slave pens, and my knowledge of my own culture was fragmented at best. When the blood spilled out of me and my heart stilled, I thought I was finally free. No. I still exist, because Hinekora scooped up my soul, and they even 'honoured' me with a position here. You know what I'll be doing? Fighting. Bleeding. Dying. <i>{Forever.} I died! I'm dead! But I'm still imprisoned! This is a load of horse dung the size of Wraeclast! This place will burn!
