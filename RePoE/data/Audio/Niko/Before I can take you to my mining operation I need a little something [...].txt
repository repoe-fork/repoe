Before I can take you to my mining operation I need a little something from you. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. 

I can smell some nearby, actually. How 'bout you follow your nose and find it, eh?
