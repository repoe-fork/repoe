Layers on layers on layers. That's how we build. Sarn built over the ruins of the Vaal. The Vaal built over an abyss of bones. What's below the bones, exile? 

I can still hear them down there, rattling around, pawing at the rocks. They want out. Want what we have. Want to take our lives over. Want to take our minds over.
