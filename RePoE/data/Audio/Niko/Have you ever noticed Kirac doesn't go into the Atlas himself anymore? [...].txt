Have you ever noticed Kirac doesn't go into the Atlas himself anymore? He's more than happy to send us all into danger from the safety of his base. He never leaves it, in fact. Have you seen the explosives lining the place? I bet he's planning something. He bloody well might just blow us all up if we refuse to do his bidding, ohoho! Hush, hush, he might hear us... can't let him know we're onto him...  just keep acting like everything's normal, right? Everything's normal, Exile...
