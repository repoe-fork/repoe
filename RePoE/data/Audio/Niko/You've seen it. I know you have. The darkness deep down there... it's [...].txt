You've seen it. I know you have. The darkness deep down there... it's growing stronger. Squeezing the light. Can't survive without the light though, can ya? Need to give it a kick up the arse. Use some of the azurite you've collected to make the lights shine brighter, else you'll have no room to bloody move.
