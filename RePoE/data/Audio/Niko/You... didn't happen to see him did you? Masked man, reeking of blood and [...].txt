You... didn't happen to see him did you? Masked man, reeking of blood and beasts. Walked right up to me. Told me the end was coming, like I didn't already know. Laughed right in his face. Called me stupid, so I left to get some dynamite... show him just how stupid I am. Only left for a moment but he was gone by the time I got back.

He comes back, I'll be here. Ready for him. Boom! Hahahaha.
