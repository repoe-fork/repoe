Kirac's a good egg, don't get me wrong. I just think it's mighty suspicious... nope, nope. I'm here because I want to help out. I have to remember that, heh. I have bad thoughts sometimes. I can usually tell the difference between the voices and my own thoughts, but spending time in the Atlas makes everything feel surreal. All I know is, there are good people here, and I want to do my part. Kirac's been kind to me.
