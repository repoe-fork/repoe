They're forcing their way in, Exile. Demons pressing their faces against the skin of the world. They almost got me. Don't you see? They were pulled back... snapped back as their claws sliced the air and nicked my clothes. They're all around us! Countless hands, emerging from nowhere, more and more of them every moment!
