Wasn't long ago I went too deep into the mine too quickly. Chasing glittering riches, I was. Lost track of me light. Strayed into the dark. Felt as if my skin was being eaten from the inside of my body. I was lucky to make it back. The deeper you go, the quicker the darkness will kill you. You need to insulate yourself at the generator. No amount of Azurite's worth your life.
