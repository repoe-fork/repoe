Machine's worth more than my life. Or yours, should it come to that, exile. No man or woman alive today could replicate it. They'll try, though. Oh, they'll try. They'll crack her open like an egg. Let her goo run across the ground and back into the mines. Back into the darkness. Gobbled up. 

Won't let that happen. Would kill anyone who tries to take her in a heartbeat. Even you, exile. Even you.
