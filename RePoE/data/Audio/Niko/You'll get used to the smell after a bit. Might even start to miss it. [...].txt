You'll get used to the smell after a bit. Might even start to miss it. Curious rock, that sulphite. Only found near the surface. Can't think of any other rock quite like it.

Its... interesting properties make it tricky to handle. Not many people want or need it. Not many people can stomach the smell. Kept me in business for a good long while 'til I ended up in the madhouse. Mostly better now, though. Mostly.
