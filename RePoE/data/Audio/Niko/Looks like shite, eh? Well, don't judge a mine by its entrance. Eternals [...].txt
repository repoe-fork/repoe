Looks like shite, eh? Well, don't judge a mine by its entrance. Eternals used to pull all sorts of goodies out of these rocks, and they never had my secret weapon. 

Just inside the mineshaft is my creaky little Crawler. Took one of the ol' Eternal torture devices and... repurposed it. Oh, it can still tear your skin off like peeling a fruit, but hopefully it won't try to. Instead, it can lay down a daisy chain of lights powered by that Voltaxic Sulphite. You'll want to be on the lookout for more of that, mind you.

This big beauty next to me? My pride and joy. Feeds Crawler with refined and purified sulphite. And it's capable of taking all sorts of the raw materials strewn below ground and turning 'em into sources of light and explosives.

How 'bout you head underground and follow the mechanical little bugger to an azurite vein, eh?
