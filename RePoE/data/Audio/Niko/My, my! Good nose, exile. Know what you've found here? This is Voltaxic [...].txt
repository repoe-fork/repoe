My, my! Good nose, exile. Know what you've found here? This is Voltaxic Sulphite. My name's Niko and I run a little mining operation of my own. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. 

You find more and I'll come right over. Don't touch it though. Stuff'll send you mad without the right precautions. You think I want to be dressed like this?

Tell you what - how about we take a look around my mine.
