Felt the sting of the hungering gloom yet? All in due time. It's hungrier than it has ever been, the darkness. Hungrier than it's ever been, and there's nothing that will sate it. You can only try to make yourself taste rotten to it. Use some of your ore at the generator, and maybe, just maybe, you'll live a little longer. Heheheh.
