This is a bad omen, exile. A real baaaad sign. What if all the water's turning to blood, eh? They say the Cataclysm did all sorts of strange things. This seems pretty strange to me! Been having a lot of dreams where I drink all that blood up. My body swells up like a big grape. Can't hold it in. BANG! I'm gone. What do you think that means, eh? Maybe I'm the only one who can stop it... Maybe I'm the reason it's here in the first place.
