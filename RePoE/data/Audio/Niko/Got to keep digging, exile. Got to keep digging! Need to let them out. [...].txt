Got to keep digging, exile. Got to keep digging! Need to let them out. Need to stop the chatter. They're too loud, exile. And they're all angry. Shouting at us. Can't understand a word. Probably get more done if they would be quiet for just one moment.

How do you stand the noise, exile? Can't even think with the bloody racket they're making. Wish someone would make 'em... disappear.
