Not too long ago, I came upon the telltale purple light that usually precedes a bit of demonic terror. Ol' Niko knew what to do, right? Just hide and wait it out. Thing is, it didn't fade like usual. The glow remained, and the demons crept about freely, more and more of them as the minutes wore on. Thought I was a goner for sure. Thankfully, I had some sulphite with me. Burned so brightly that a few of the fiends began to recoil, then catalysed an explosion. I was coated in soot and demon-giblets, running for my life. Wouldn't go back there, not even if you paid me. Voltaxic sulphite has saved my life many times over. There's a reason I hold the stuff in such high regard, heh.
