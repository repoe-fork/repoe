See that? One moment, big blades, next moment, gone! Should be able to go in there now. Heard this place reeked of Voltaxic Sulphite back in the day. I was planning on having a wander down there, only... I think I can hear things shuffling around down there, and I'm more of a lover than a fighter. 

Actually, if you're headed in there, maybe you could do us a favour. See, I run a little mining operation of my own. Mining's dangerous at the best of times, but it's suicidal without a proper source of light. I've got lights, just ain't got no power. Run on Voltaxic Sulphite, they do. Nasty rocks. Stink like a dozen eggs rotting in the summer sun on the back of a whale carcass, and they're less stable than the High Templar on a bad day. Bloody toxic too. 

Keep your nostrils peeled for some Voltaxic Sulphite while you're down there, or anywhere really.
