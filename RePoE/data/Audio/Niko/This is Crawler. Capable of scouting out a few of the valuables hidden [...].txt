This is Crawler. Capable of scouting out a few of the valuables hidden down here, but needs your muscle to get to 'em. Tell it where you want to go, and try to stay alive 'til you get there. Crawler will burn through sulphite on the way, and we ain't made of sulphite, so choose carefully.

How about you follow it to a nearby Azurite vein, eh? Make sure you stick near Crawler's light. Believe me... you don't want to get dragged into the darkness.
