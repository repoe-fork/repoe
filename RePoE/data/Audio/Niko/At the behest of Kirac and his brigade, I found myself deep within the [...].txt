At the behest of Kirac and his brigade, I found myself deep within the Atlas. I was minding my own business, as I usually do. And then I saw not one, but two... hands. Horrific, inhuman hands... At first, I thought it might be a mirage, but before I knew it, I was surrounded, and damn near gutted by one of them â€“ which snapped me out of my reverie good and proper, heh. Then I realised there were hands popping up all over the place... and a deluge of demons coming for me. I had no choice but to run.
