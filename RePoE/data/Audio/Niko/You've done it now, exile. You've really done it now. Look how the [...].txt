You've done it now, exile. You've really done it now. Look how the darkness crowds around the light, waiting to pounce on you. The deeper you go, the stronger it gets. Pushes in towards the light. Only one way to fight back, exile. More light. Brighter light! Upgrade it at the generator with your ore. See how the darkness feels about that, eh? Heheheheh.
