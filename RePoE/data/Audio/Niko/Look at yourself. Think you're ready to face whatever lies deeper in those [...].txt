Look at yourself. Think you're ready to face whatever lies deeper in those mines, do ya? Think the equipment you're wearing will keep you alive? Ha! The darkness will eat right through that. It's strong, exile. Stronger than you. Only thing that might keep you standing is using some azurite to insulate yourself. I'd do that if I were you. Generator can take care of it for ya. Or if you'd rather, you can just submit to the darkness like all the others, heheheheh.
