I don't often go into the Atlas, but when I do, I'm there for one thing: sulphite. Mind you, it's not the most pleasant place to be, heh, especially not when the monsters are behaving... shall we say, erratically? They seemed to be possessed by unseen forces, and were spouting all kinds of gibberish. It was very... unnerving.
