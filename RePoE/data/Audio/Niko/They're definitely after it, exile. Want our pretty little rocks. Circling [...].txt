They're definitely after it, exile. Want our pretty little rocks. Circling us like a pack of wolves. Like the darkness deep down in the mine. They want to swallow us both up and take our rocks. But we will have the last laugh. "HA!" We'll say. HA! HA! 

The sulphite's ours. Pumping light into the darkness with our pretty little rocks. Carrying us deeper and deeper into the unknown and unknowable. 

Closer and closer... to them.
