Enoch was the sort of man who'd starve to make sure you had something to eat. The sort of man whose oath to protect and preserve informed everything he did. He deserved far better than he got, and we can do nothing for him now. But with his service records and his tags, we can at least let his mum and dad know what happened. 

Don't worry, Exile. I'll handle this messy part. You've done more than enough. Thank you.
