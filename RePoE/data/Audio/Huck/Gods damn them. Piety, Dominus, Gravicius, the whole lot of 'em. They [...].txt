Gods damn them. Piety, Dominus, Gravicius, the whole lot of 'em. They moved Enoch into an 'Unspecified Research' unit. Dead a month later, the cause listed as 'Severe reaction to subdermal augmentations'. They tried to turn him into a gods-damned gemling, and killed him in the process. Oh, Enoch. I'm so sorry, mate. 

I appreciate the backup, Exile. I need a bit of time to sort my emotions out, but I reckon I'll have more work for you soon enough.
