Sir! Sorry, old habit. You'll get used to it. Blackguard training did a number on me. I'm Huck. Served in the Oriath 3rd for five years. Dishonourably discharged, though I consider that an honour. 

My time with the Blackguards put a lot of things in perspective, least once I had some distance from them. What we do here might be illegal, but that don't make it wrong. 

You need something -- anything -- you come to me, yeah? We're family now. Family look out for each other.
