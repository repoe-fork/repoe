Ah, my contract. Took it out not long after joining the Ring to track down a mate of mine. Man named Enoch. Not easy making friends at my age, but active duty has a way of forging near-unbreakable bonds. Enoch and I got real close. Might as well've been brothers. Right before I got discharged, Enoch was called up to a special unit we'd heard rumours about. A group under the direction of Piety, of all people. Supposedly some elite strike force, but no one personally knew anyone who was a part of it. 'Til Enoch, that is. 

After I started working for the Boss, I asked Whakano to find Enoch. Thought he might be a good fit. But Whakano found no traces. I want to break into the Blackguard Records and find out where he's deployed.
