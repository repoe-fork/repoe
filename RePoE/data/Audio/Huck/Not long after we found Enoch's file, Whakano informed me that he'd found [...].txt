Not long after we found Enoch's file, Whakano informed me that he'd found Enoch's family, and that even they had no idea where he was. They assumed he was still on duty.

Can you believe that? The bloody Templars had the gall to massacre Enoch and not even tell his family. That just don't sit right with me. 

His records don't list a final resting place, but I know that most blackguards who died on duty were cremated and put to rest in the tunnels beneath the city. It's a long-shot, but maybe we can find some trace of Enoch, to give his parents peace.
