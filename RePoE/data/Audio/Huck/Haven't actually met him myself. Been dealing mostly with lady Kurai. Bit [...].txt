Haven't actually met him myself. Been dealing mostly with lady Kurai. Bit like the old days, really. Orders come down the chain and stop when they hit the right pair of ears.

I'm eager to meet him though. Owe him my life. Had some very dark days after I got discharged. Not a lot of people want to hire veterans, especially when they leave the service under less-than-ideal circumstances. But the Boss secured me a place to live, and gave me a steady income and work to keep me busy.
