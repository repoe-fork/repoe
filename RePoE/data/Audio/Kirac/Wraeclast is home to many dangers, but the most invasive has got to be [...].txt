Wraeclast is home to many dangers, but the most invasive has got to be those damned wandering spirits. I've actually been possessed by them, more than once. Oh, it's a strange experience, I'll give you that, but they can be resisted. If it happens to you, ah, I'm sure you'll shake it off... eventually.
