Being a tracker myself, I'm no stranger to the hunt, but him - he embodies the hunt, and nothing else. I tried to ask for his aid in chasing down the Conquerors, but it was impossible to get a straight answer out of him. I was given the distinct impression that he encounters them regularly while cavorting out in the wilds. He thinks... <i>{very highly} of each of them... even Sirus. I can't imagine what the two of them would even say to each other.
