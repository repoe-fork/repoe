Ah, the Battle of Phaaryl. My brigade was ordered to attack what our commanders believed to be a minor Harbinger outpost. To put it lightly, they were wrong. It was actually the primary staging ground for the entire invasion. Four thousand men marched onto that battlefield. A week later, when the Oriathan navy arrived to cover our escape, only two hundred of us were still alive. We did our share of damage - you can count on it - but the eager young man that went into that battle emerged disillusioned and weary.
