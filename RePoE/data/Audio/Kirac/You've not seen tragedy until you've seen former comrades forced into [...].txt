You've not seen tragedy until you've seen former comrades forced into killing one another by circumstance. Sirus could have been our salvation against the coming darkness, had he not been consumed by his own. The powerful exile I was working with at the time gave her life to deal Sirus a near-lethal wound, and then eight hundred of the Vanguard died finishing the bloody job. I myself earned an injury that will never fully heal... and Zana... well, often the heart suffers deeper cuts than the body. That was the last time any of us worked with her.
