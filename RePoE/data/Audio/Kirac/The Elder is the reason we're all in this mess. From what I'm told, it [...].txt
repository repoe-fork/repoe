The Elder is the reason we're all in this mess. From what I'm told, it preyed upon humanity for thousands of years, eating memories and shrivelling bodies. That I can't vouch for, but I do know that other entities like it have noticed its sudden absence. We can ill afford that kind of attention. In defeating the Elder, the Elderslayers may have doomed us all.
