Navali is dead, as I understand it. Or somewhere between life and death. I asked her if Hinekora could save Baran by doing the same for him, and Navali... she spoke with anger for the first and only time I've ever heard. One word: <i>{fool!}

It never occurred to me that her endless living death might be... painful.
