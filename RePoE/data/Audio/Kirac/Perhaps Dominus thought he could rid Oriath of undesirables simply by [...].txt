Perhaps Dominus thought he could rid Oriath of undesirables simply by sending them away, but if so, he was wrong. One spring, I was assigned to a company meant to hunt down groups of exiles that had become... problematic. It started working together to raid shipping lines and supply caravans, and believe me, we soldiers were in over our heads. Not sure how I survived that assignment. To be honest... Not many did.
