After the massacre at Phaaryl, I had nightmares for months. I would dream that I was a Harbinger. I would dream that my fellow soldiers were attacking me, and I had to slaughter them to survive. I don't know why, but I always woke up feeling... guilty. Not for killing my fellows, because that had just been a dream, but... for surviving the real thing. Is that strange? To feel guilty for not dying? I wish I could reach back and tell that devastated young man I was that... that it wasn't his fault.

Ahem... enough reminiscing. Let's get back to work.
