Caeserius tells me that Sirus is on the verge of completing a map device. We should have counted on this happening once we prevented the Conquerors from interfering with each other.

The device's growing energy has given away the location of a secret citadel hidden within a tremendous storm. Caeserius can get us inside, and, from tracking your encounters with Sirus, I happen to know he isn't currently there. If we can get to his map device and destroy it before he can use it, we might just finish this before it begins.

The world is at stake once again. Danger be damned! We're both going with you. If this is the last time we speak, it has been an honour.
