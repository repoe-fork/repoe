The Maven is a powerful entity with a penchant for forcing combatants to fight to the death. Then, she resurrects them to do it all again, over and over. She's tortured more than a few of my men and added them to her collection... my own brother included.

A previous exile worked with her on our behalf, catching her interest for a time. That didn't last. Don't let her make you part of her collection.
