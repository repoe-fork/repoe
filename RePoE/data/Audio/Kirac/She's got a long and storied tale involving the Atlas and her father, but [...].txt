She's got a long and storied tale involving the Atlas and her father, but you'll have to ask someone else about that. I'm not one for gossip. All I'll say: our campaign in the Atlas resulted in the death of a man she loved. She seemed filled with despair after that, and then, that sadness became anger. I know what a desire for vengeance looks like, Godslayer. Someone's going to get what's coming to them.
