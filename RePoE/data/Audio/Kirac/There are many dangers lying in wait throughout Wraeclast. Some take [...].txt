There are many dangers lying in wait throughout Wraeclast. Some take advantage of basic human impulses, like curiosity. In the early days of my first command, we entered a valley to find the abominations we'd been pursuing were imprisoned within crystals. In our complacence, we assumed this encounter would be like those we had seen before, with one primary creature and some subordinate ones. However, we weren't prepared for multiple powerful foes to emerge. We lost two good soldiers in the ensuing struggle. I should have paid better attention.
