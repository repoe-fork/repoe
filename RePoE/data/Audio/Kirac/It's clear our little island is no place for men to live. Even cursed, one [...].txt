It's clear our little island is no place for men to live. Even cursed, one could say, though we are not entirely blameless for those disasters. We thought Kitava's rampage was bad enough, let alone the domination by the Templars and the crackdown under Innocence... but Oriath was attacked yet again while you were gone. The rebuilding efforts were all for nothing. The Vanguard undertook the largest evacuation in history... hundreds of ships... and Oriath has been abandoned.

No small irony that the Oriathan people now depend upon the Karui we once enslaved. I always said that if you kick a rhoa in the butt, one day, it'll kick you in the head, but I underestimated the honour of our new hosts. They're different after the death of their gods... and we are, too, after the departure of ours. I wasn't a believer, but I can feel it. We're on our own.

We're going to have to work together to face what comes next...
