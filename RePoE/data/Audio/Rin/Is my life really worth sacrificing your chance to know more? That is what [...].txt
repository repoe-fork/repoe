Is my life really worth sacrificing your chance to know more? That is what you would be doing were you to kill me, Exile. Instead, let me show you how useful I could be to you. I am quick to make friends, and even quicker to learn what it is I wish to learn. Allow me the chance to prove my talents to you, and all I learn is yours.
