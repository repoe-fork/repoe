My poor Greust. A kind man. A strong man. And now... I begged him not to meddle with that relic. It washed ashore after the earthquake and Greust simply had to know whether it was a danger to us... to me.

The unholy thing within that device... it possessed Greust. Turned him into a monstrosity. We fled the village, and as I turned back... I saw... he was killing them, the stragglers, killing them all! Even the children!

My Greust is dead. That thing that has stolen his body... please, destroy it.
