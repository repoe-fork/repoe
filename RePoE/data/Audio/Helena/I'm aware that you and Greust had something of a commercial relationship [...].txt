I'm aware that you and Greust had something of a commercial relationship prior to his... accident. As is the Azmeri custom, Greust's few possessions have now passed to me. I'm by no means the warrior he was, yet I know my blades and bows well enough.

At least it's something I can do to honour his memory, and to keep my mind off things.
