There's an Azmeri shrine, tucked away in the Northern Forest. Greust took me there, told me it was a memorial to those who had gone before him, a place where their spirits could rest. When he passed, he wanted his remains to be laid to rest with the bones of his people. His body... I find it difficult to even think about it... but I doubt it will ever be recovered. Yet there might still be a way. He gave me his necklace, the fangs he earned when he rose from boyhood to manhood, handed it to me for safekeeping only moments before, before Ralakesh... it's almost as if he knew what was to come. 

Please, could you deliver this necklace to the shrine for me? Put Greust's spirit to rest? I would do it myself, but the journey to the Northern Forest is not what it was. These lands have changed, and not for the better.
