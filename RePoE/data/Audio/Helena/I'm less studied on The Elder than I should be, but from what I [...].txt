I'm less studied on The Elder than I should be, but from what I understand, it was an otherworldly entity that preyed on humanity for thousands of years. It served a force called Decay. Not too long ago, the Elderslayers defeated The Elder with the help of Zana Caeserius, but that seems to have simply led to another problem. The Elder's absence means the Atlas is a prize trophy left undefended against a cosmos full of hungry horrors.
