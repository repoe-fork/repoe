I feel I have failed my poor Greust, not being able to return his bones to the resting place of his people. Still, we have done all we could, considering the circumstances. Greust was a practical man at heart. He would understand.

You deserve our thanks. Here are some of Greust's most treasured possessions. I'm sure he would have wanted you to have one.
