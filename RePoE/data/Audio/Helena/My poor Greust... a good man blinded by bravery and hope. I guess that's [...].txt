My poor Greust... a good man blinded by bravery and hope. I guess that's why I loved him. He truly believed that if he stood against Oak that courage would triumph. Even he should have seen it to be hopeless when they descended upon the village, enslaved us all. They cut his head clean from his body... stuck it on a pike, paraded it before us. 

Then it was as if the very rocks cried out against this cruelty. The earth shook and that blasphemous relic emerged from the water. Whatever was inside, it transformed Oak, turned him into... well, I suppose he simply became what he had been in his heart all along.
