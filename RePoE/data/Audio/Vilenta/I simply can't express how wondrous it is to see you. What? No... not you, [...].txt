I simply can't express how wondrous it is to see you. What? No... not you, exile. The Miasmeter. The hope of humanity lies in this beautiful device and the precious knowledge it shall divulge.

Far more useful than an accidental hulk of meat and instinct like yourself. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to discover that your slaying of the Beast correlates directly to the strife we must currently suffer.

At least you've proved useful enough to return the Miasmeter to me. That deserves some small reward, I suppose.
