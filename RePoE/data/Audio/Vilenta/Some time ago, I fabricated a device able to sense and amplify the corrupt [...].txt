Some time ago, I fabricated a device able to sense and amplify the corrupt murmurings of Wraeclast. A Miasmeter.

I listened to those whispers for years, lingering beyond sane comprehension. And then the scream... such profound agony that my mind was nearly sundered by its percussion. I thought another cataclysm might be upon us. But no, it was you, slaying the Beast. I was witness to a singularly potent cadence.

This corruption... I am convinced that it holds the very key to our human history, and with it, our very existence. Yet without the Miasmeter, I'm condemned to deafened ignorance.

It remains in Piety's laboratory, as long as Utula's miscreants haven't vandalised the poor thing. Find it!
