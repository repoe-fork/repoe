Ramako is both the Father of Light, and Father of the Sun. These are not the same duty. In the early days, he was just the Father of Light, and he brought beauty and warmth everywhere he went. The Mother of the Sun, Sione, lived alone in a jade palace in the sky. At that time, the Sun was no brighter than any other star, and it was verdant green. Sione, however, was the most ambitious of the gods. She traded away all of her tribe's possessions to foreign cultures in exchange for gold, and she plated her entire palace with that useless but shiny material. Her tribe was on the verge of starvation, but she asked them to trust her. They put on a festival with what little they had left, and to this, Ramako was invited.

In awe of the supposed wealth of Sione, Ramako accepted her invitation to go through the traditions together. Once he entered her golden palace, his light reflected countless times, blazing warmth and life all over the world. Sione's palace cyclically rose above the world, then back into it, and while it was in the sky, that time became known as Day. To her credit, this shining beacon drew food, wealth, and respect to her tribe. Her gambit paid off. Ramako became the Father of the Sun ever after.
