I was quite young when the world ruptured. The moon turned crimson, fire rained from the sky, warriors went mad with blood fever, and the seas boiled. None of us knew what caused it, but the destruction came from the direction of Sarn, and the mountains near it. The madmen must have gone too far... I had nightmares about that time for over a decade, until I finally traveled to the Isle of the Shrikes and passed my test of adulthood. After that, I felt like I could handle anything.
