The other tribes tell all sorts of stories about the end of time. Those are just fables. You see, the Sun sets somewhere inside the world each night, but it also changes course from season to season. Eventually, it will stray too near, and Wraeclast will be burned away by its heat. However, the Sun brings life as well, so once it returns to the sky, as it always does, there will be a burst of verdancy unlike we have never ever seen. If you think about it, it's the only end that makes sense.
