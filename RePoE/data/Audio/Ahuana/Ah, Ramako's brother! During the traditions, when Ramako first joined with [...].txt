Ah, Ramako's brother! During the traditions, when Ramako first joined with Sione, Rongokurai came to the feasts at her palace. This confused the people and the animals, as the sky became dark at strange times when Rongokurai's darkness dimmed the reflecting light of her golden walls. This greatly irritated Sione, but there was nothing she could do. He was family! Her own sister often caused such disruptions already when that silver palace neared hers, and now Ramako's brother would interfere as well. She resolved to hold family gatherings as little as possible. That is why eclipses only happen every few years. The two sisters put aside their eternal war for a brief time to satisfy their traditional familial obligations. Even the gods must follow the Way.
