You found my mother's soul? I knew she was still out there somewhere! Though I do not believe she needs our aid. If you knew my mother like I did, you would know that nothing could keep her trapped against her will, especially not with an army at her back. If she is still fighting there, then she must believe that the battle is necessary. We have no idea what the stakes are, so we should leave her to it. If she required our aid, she would have requested it long ago.
