After my mother's disappearance, the tribes began to fracture. I tried to take on the role of Queen, but inheriting such a title felt a bit too much like monarchy and empire, and the other tribes weren't receptive. Not after their experiences battling the Eternals. So, I used what meager power I had to suggest a new form of united government, a council of chieftains. From the trickle of news we get through living Karui that come to us for guidance, I hear that some form of that is still going on. I'm rather proud of that.
