I died in childbirth, which is considered a warrior's death. I died knowing my daughter would live on. Then, because I was here, I was able to see her grow and thrive. She visited me for advice often, and I treasure those memories. Now, she fights as one of my own in these Halls. Among others, <i>{her} daughter, and her daughter's daughter, also joined us. We now have dozens of descendants coming to us for wisdom. Life and death are strange partners. I have been here for far longer than I was alive, and my extended family only knows me as an ancestral spirit.
