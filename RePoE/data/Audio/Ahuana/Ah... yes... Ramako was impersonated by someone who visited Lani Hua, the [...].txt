Ah... yes... Ramako was  impersonated by someone who visited Lani Hua, the Mother of the Moon, in his guise. My ancestors suspected the truth of this immediately. Arohongui had a very strange inheritance, with abilities prone to darkness and illusions, quite unlike Ramako's golden strength and honesty. There is a tale, very rarely told, of a deceiver being caught and locked away for this crime. Supposedly, it was the ancient elders of my tribe that enacted this justice. We consider the matter settled, but Sione and Lani Hua continue to battle for eternity in distant realms... they do not listen to us. They do not listen to anyone. All they care about is vengeance. It might be controversial in Western Ngamakanui, but I say that the gods who forget their people are not owed our loyalty.
