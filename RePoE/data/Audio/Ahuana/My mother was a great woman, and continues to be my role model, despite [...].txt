My mother was a great woman, and continues to be my role model, despite her inexplicable absence here. The other chieftains often talk about her wartime acts when she fought alongside Kaom, but by the time I was old enough to know her, she had long been Queen of the still-united tribes. I grew up in a time of turmoil and nightmare in the wake of the Cataclysm that destroyed the Eternals. Because she once helped put the men in power who likely caused it, my mother taught me that war is not the glorious endeavour our Way makes it out to be. All she wanted, by the end, was peace. She was begrudgingly taking an army raised from multiple tribes to deal with a strange threat on the edge of Ngamakanui... when she and her legion vanished without a trace.
