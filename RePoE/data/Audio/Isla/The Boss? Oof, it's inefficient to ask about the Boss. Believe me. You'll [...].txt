The Boss? Oof, it's inefficient to ask about the Boss. Believe me. You'll go round and round, a spinning gear 'na machine made of secret parts. The one thing you should never rely on is a mechanism you don't understand. It's liable to implode, or <i>{ex}plode. Neither is pretty when your arse is sittin' upon it hopin' to fly somewhere. The Boss put in an order for an air-sail once, for a job. Impossible, I told Kurai. Turned out it worked! It just didn't go with the poor sod we hired. It stayed with us in flames while he took to the skies. He achieved a perfect parabolic arc right onto the tower we were aiming for. Survived the trip, too, judgin' by the screaming. But getting back down? Oof, the Boss never ordered a falling machine. That's on him. Gotta think things through, mind you!
