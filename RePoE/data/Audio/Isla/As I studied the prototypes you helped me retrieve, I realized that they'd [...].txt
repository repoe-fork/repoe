As I studied the prototypes you helped me retrieve, I realized that they'd already been examined... by someone else. The Templars must have lied about declaring my work heretical. They're trying to build them for their own gain! I cannot imagine what disaster they'll bring upon us if they manage to do so.

We already have the prototypes, so now we must steal the designs they created based on them. We'll need to steal the blueprints for my Extreme Warmth Beam, my Storm Wooing Rod... hmm, the Mind Sublimator... and the Unbreakable, of course! I don't claim to be the most imaginative namer, but it is what it is. They're all related, eventually intended to be part of one single superweapon, so the designs should all be in one place.

Let's go retrieve those blueprints!
