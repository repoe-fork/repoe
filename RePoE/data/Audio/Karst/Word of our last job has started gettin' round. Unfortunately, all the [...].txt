Word of our last job has started gettin' round. Unfortunately, all the credit is goin' to an old rival of ours. That don't sit right with me. It's one thing to steal a man's property, but to steal a man's hard work? No, I ain't gonna let that stand.

So we're going to leave a little present at my ol' rival's abode. One of my prized lockpicks, dipped in the very same toxin.
