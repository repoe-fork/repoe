'Ello rookie! Found a few markers, did ya? Apparently the Boss sees somethin' in you, but we won't know for sure 'til you're on the wrong side of a lance. I'm Karst, and there's not a lock in this world that I can't open. All you have to do is make sure I live long enough to open 'em. Adiyah'll get us to the job, and I'll show ya the ropes. Don't get tangled in 'em, 'cause it ain't my job to cut you free.
