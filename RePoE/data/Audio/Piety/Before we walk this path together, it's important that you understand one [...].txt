Before we walk this path together, it's important that you understand one thing about me.

I don't regret a single thing that I've done. I set out to raise humanity up from the cloying mud of its fleshly ignorance. My mistake was not in the aspiration, but in the execution.

Now I intend to correct that mistake.

Really, I'm not helping you, exile. You're helping me.

So, have you found those juicy organs for me yet?
