Twice now you've baptised me in my own blood, Templar. So believe me when I tell you that I've had all the divine revelations that I can stand.

When we shared our 'moment' back in the Lunaris, part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
