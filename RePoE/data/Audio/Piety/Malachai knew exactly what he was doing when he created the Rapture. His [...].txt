Malachai knew exactly what he was doing when he created the Rapture.

His primary concern... get inside the Beast and take up the reins of true power. And his second objective... incite a Cataclysm that would wipe the very thought of resistance from this land. 

The Beast is the source of all thaumaturgy, the one power in this world that transforms 'what is real' into 'what is imagined'.

The entire world is now at the mercy of one man's vision. It won't be the future I imagined, and it won't be the future you imagined, either. While he remains within the Black Core, the only imagination that matters... is Malachai's.
