That's twice now that I've experienced a 'little death' with you, Duelist. This time it was just the rude awakening I needed.

When we shared our 'moment' back in the Lunaris temple, part of me wishes I'd died at your feet as intended. The little girl within me that shies from darkness, from greatness.
