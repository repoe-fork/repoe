You, my champion, have caused me more pain than any other man in my life.

Yet do you know from whence my true agony has originated? Not from the violence you have inflicted upon me. I'm a big girl. I can take it. No, it is having to look into those pretty eyes of yours across this chasm of creed that separates us.

Until this moment.
