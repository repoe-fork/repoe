We, the Court of Reckoning find you, Doedre Stamatis, guilty of the following transgressions against God:

<italic>{Perversion of God's Creation

Promotion of Heretical Beliefs

Unlawful Enslavement of Eternal Citizens

Torture of the Innocent

Murder of the Servants of Purity}

For these most severe crimes, I do sentence Doedre Darktongue to burn at the stake till naught is left but ash. May her life serve as penance for the lives she has taken, and let Purity sweep away the dust of her deeds from our firmament.

- High Templar Voll, Commander of the Army of Purity
