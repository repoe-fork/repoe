She's stronger than she knows. She doesn't need me to fight battles on her behalf, nor would she want me to. When I first arrived here, many of the other chieftains were hostile, and the most traditional among them outright rejected me. It was she who vouched for me. The opportunity to fight allowed me to prove myself, as I knew I could, and I have led Tasalio's warriors ever since. In Ikiaho, I could not have asked for a better friend. Sometimes, we even sneak out of here, for a glimpse at the Moon and the sea.
