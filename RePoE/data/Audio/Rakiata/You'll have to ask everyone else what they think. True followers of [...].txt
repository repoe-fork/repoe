You'll have to ask everyone else what they think. True followers of Tasalio do not trouble themselves with thoughts of such a far-flung future. Each day that you can recline on your <i>{waikoama}, feel the waves beneath you, and take in the sun and the sky... that is a day to treasure. I do not have those anymore, but I console myself with the knowledge that my descendants do. Live for today, outsider. Yesterday... tomorrow... they do not exist. You are only ever here, now.
