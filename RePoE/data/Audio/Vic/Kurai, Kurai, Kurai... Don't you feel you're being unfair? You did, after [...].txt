Kurai, Kurai, Kurai... Don't you feel you're being unfair? You did, after all, break into my home. You took something which I value. O' Eternal. A first edition. Signed by Victario himself. My parents, rest their souls, were so fond of his work that I was named after him! Am I not owed some sort of... reparations?
