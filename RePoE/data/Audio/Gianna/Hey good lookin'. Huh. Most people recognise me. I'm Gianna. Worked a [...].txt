Hey good lookin'. Huh. Most people recognise me. I'm Gianna. Worked a spell in the Chitus Theatre, back when you could leave your house without being followed by Templar secret police. I was Shavronne in <italic>{An Axiom Tragedy}. I played Dialla, the Gemling Queen, in <italic>{Purity Tales}, and the fair lady Merveil in <italic>{Daresso and Merveil}, for which I was very nearly nominated to receive a 'Tario.
