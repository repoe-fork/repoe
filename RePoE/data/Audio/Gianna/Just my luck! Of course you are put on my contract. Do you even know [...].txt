Just my luck! Of course you are put on my contract. Do you even know anything about the theatre? The cursed play? The one no performer should ever name, lest they end up consumed by the phantom that haunts it?

It's said that the play's author wrote it while high as an eagle on ergot. He didn't know, of course, and died upon penning the final word. 

The play, whose name I shall not utter, is about a beautiful young lady who finds herself swept into a world beneath the sands of the Vastiri, where the dead have built a city of bones. She marries a statue, becomes the queen of this city, and then her skin peels off and a hundred little versions of her spill out. Completely nutty. 

It's locked up with the rest of the works deemed distasteful by the Templar, and I simply must have it.
