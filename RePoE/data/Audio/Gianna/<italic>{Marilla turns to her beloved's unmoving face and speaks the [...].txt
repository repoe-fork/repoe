<italic>{Marilla turns to her beloved's unmoving face and speaks the blessed words:

Marilla: Two into one, one into many, to churn the world beneath the crashing dunes. 

Marilla's body shatters like porcelain, each fragment becoming Marilla. Each new Marilla shatters again, and again, each fragment becomes whole. The stage is flooded by Marilla. All is Marilla. The statue rises and exits stage right.

I think I might just stick to the unbanned works for a little while, actually. Thanks, though.
