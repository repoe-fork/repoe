A blacksmith was frustrated that she could never forge the same weapon more than once. There was always a different balance, or a slightly different shape. So, she set about making one perfect blade. It took most of her lifetime, but when she was done, she placed it in clay. The clay became a mold, and from that mold, many perfect blades were forged.
