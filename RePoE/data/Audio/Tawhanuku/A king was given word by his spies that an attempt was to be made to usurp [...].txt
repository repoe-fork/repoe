A king was given word by his spies that an attempt was to be made to usurp his throne. He did not know who was behind the plot, so he trusted only his own thoughts. He ruminated on it while he held court, and began seeing dark intent in every comment, every dance, and every laugh. Whenever a shadow moved, he jumped. Whenever a friend gripped his arm, he braced for an attack. Eventually, unable to stand the tension any longer, he ordered his guards to slaughter the entire court. The king was left in a bloody throne room, alone and aghast. Without subjects, he was no longer a king. He was merely a madman.
