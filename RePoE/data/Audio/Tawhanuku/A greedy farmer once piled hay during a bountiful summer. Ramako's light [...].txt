A greedy farmer once piled hay during a bountiful summer. Ramako's light and Valako's rains were given in equal measure. The farmer believed it would always be so, thus he harvested all that grew within his sight, and gathered it near his home. When the rains withdrew and the land became dry, a stray spark from his hearth burned it all down.
