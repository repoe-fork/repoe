No matter how long it truly ends up being, existence always feels too short a season. Lucky are those who get to do it all over again, once Time begins anew. Fresh-faced, a weapon in hand, facing a savage and untamed land with limitless potential... youth, or something like it, granted to the bold. That is what it means to be alive. The dead will always be here, forever unchanging, locked in a dance we cannot change.
