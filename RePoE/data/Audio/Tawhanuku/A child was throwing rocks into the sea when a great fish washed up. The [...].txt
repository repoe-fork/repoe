A child was throwing rocks into the sea when a great fish washed up. The fish called for aid, and the child carried it back into the water. The fish thanked him, and offered to show him the world beneath the waves. The boy accepted, and held on to its fin. They swam through vast coral palaces and thick swarms of iridescent life. The boy looked on with wonder, laughing all the way, until he began to understand how vast the ocean truly was. He could not let go until the journey was complete, but the journey seemed to be without end. The boy no longer smiled, and was forlorn ever after.
