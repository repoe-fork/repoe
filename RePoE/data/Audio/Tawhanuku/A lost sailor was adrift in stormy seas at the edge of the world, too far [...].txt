A lost sailor was adrift in stormy seas at the edge of the world, too far for Tasalio to come to his aid. He had left his home, his family, and his village, but not willingly. He held onto driftwood for a time without end, overcome with sadness. When he finally washed ashore, he staggered to the nearest village. To his surprise, they recognised him, and greeted him with warmth. Looking in the river, he saw that he had a new face. Here, too, he had a home, and a family. Indeed, he had never left at all. It was he who had never known himself.
