A gull was flying through the sky when it sighted a fish. It dove, but a larger bird snatched it out of the sea. The gull cawed loudly and angrily, and the larger bird dropped the fish. The gull ate well that day. It continued cawing at other birds along the shore, taking what was theirs. Eventually, it saw a great feast laid out near a fire, and it cawed aggressively at the creature beside it. That creature was a Karui woman, far stronger than any bird, and she happily added the gull to her feast.
