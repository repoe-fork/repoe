A great darkness fell upon an island one ill-fated season. A young woman held a torch aloft in the unnatural night, and others crawled their way to her. Along the way, they gathered sticks and branches, hoping to feed her flame. Rather than build a bonfire to be encircled by worried eyes, she had them craft torches of their own, and she shared her light. They went out into the darkness unafraid, but now, they could see each other in the distance.
