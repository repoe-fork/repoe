A king and a chieftain met on the battlefield, with great armies arrayed on either side. The king grinned and demanded surrender. The chieftain crossed his arms and gave no response. The king suggested that the two sides part ways in peace. The chieftain glowered and said nothing. Finally, the king begged for the chieftain to depart, and offered great wealth in exchange for mercy. The chieftain touched the axe at his side, considering... but then accepted the offer. No warriors died that day, and no songs would be sung of that conflict, but a great victory was still achieved.
