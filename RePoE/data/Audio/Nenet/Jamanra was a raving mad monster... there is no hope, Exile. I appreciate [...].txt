Jamanra was a raving mad monster... there is no hope, Exile. I appreciate your aid, but I no longer see a way forward. Who was I to think that I could change thousands of years of brutal tradition? This life of thievery and villainy is all that there is for me.

I think I'm going to take refuge in mead from now on.
