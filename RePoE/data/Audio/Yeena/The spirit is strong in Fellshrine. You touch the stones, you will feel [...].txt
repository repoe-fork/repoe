The spirit is strong in Fellshrine. You touch the stones, you will feel it. They spoke to me, those stones. Told me to take their altar, and to find the hand of a Good Man. He lived in that 'church' as you call it. The altar is his and it will wake when he touches it once more.

You could find the Good Man, bring me his hand? When the spirit of the altar awakes, I will share it with you. I promise.
