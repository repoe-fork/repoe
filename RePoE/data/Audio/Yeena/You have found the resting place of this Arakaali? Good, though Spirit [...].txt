You have found the resting place of this Arakaali? Good, though Spirit tells me that we will not reach her, not without help. Webs she weaves with fibres of faith and fear. Too strong to break. Too strong to cut.

Yet there is an Azmeri potion, most ancient. 'Fire Dew'. It might be enough to burn a path, make way for us to pass into heart of spider web. I could brew it for you, but there is one ingredient I do not possess. The blazing blood of the firefly that lives in the most dreaded of thickets. 

Travel I shall to Arakaali, to sit on her doorstep until you bring me seven flames that flit and fly. Then I make you a Fire Dew and together we go talk to this bride of foolish Silk.
