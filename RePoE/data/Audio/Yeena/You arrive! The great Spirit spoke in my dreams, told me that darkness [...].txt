You arrive! The great Spirit spoke in my dreams, told me that darkness would again drown our lands. And you, exile, would walk before the flood. 

But what is this? You are not alone. A shade, a memory, older even than... no... older than Spirit? Fear grips my throat, I shake, but the Spirit drapes a warming cloak upon my shoulders. 

This ancient ghost that follows you, it has the trust of the Spirit, and if the Spirit trusts then I trust.
