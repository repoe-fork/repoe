Now you're a familiar face! A face that cost me a good deal of coin back at the arenas in Theopolis. Took you for a privileged pretty boy with a death wish. Bet all I had against you.

Turns out you're as dandy with a blade as you were with your wardrobe. Well, at least you've brought Clarissa back to us. I'll take that as half payment of what I figure you owe me.

Problem is, <i>{one} doe-eyed lover isn't much good to anyone. Like gloves, they tend to be more useful in pairs. The missing glove, in this case, is a young fella named Tolman.

Fetch Tolman back for us and you and I can happily call it quits.
