Not that I'm complaining! In my experience, theocracy's never been great for entrepreneurs like me, unless you're in the holy relics business. It's too single-minded. Too orderly. Give me chaos any old day, for it is in chaos that opportunity is bred.

Sarn can get back to its usual state of mayhem and I can get back down to business. Everyone's a winner!
