If you cut a Perandus, and you definitely should not do so, but if you do, we bleed diplomacy. Don't - don't test it. It's a metaphor. Put the knife away, and allow me to do what I was born to do: exchange information. If I whisper into the ear of a cohort, they will whisper into mine. And if you should overhear such whispers? Well, there's simply nothing I could do about that!
