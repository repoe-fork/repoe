The Syndicate is wonderful. It really is. If you weren't trying to kill all of us, I'd suggest you try it. Except I fear there's no more room... hmm... I know! I'll take a little leave of absence, and you can try it out for yourself! Might be tricky convincing the others, but, well, that won't really be my problem, will it?
