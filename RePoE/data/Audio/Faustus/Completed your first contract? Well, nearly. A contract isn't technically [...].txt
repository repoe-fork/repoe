Completed your first contract? Well, nearly. A contract isn't technically complete until the goods are in the hands of the client. You give me the urn, and I'll give you the markers you've earned. I yearn for the urn, to give you what you've earned! What fun. Don't go spending your markers all in one place! That, my friend, is a little joke. You see, they're only good here, so to imply you could spend them elsewhere is very humorous indeed.

I like you, Exile. Don't do anything stupid and ruin that.
