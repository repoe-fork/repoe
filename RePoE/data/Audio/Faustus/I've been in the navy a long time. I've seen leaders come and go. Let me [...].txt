I've been in the navy a long time. I've seen leaders come and go. Let me tell you; Darnaw is a fool. A bumpkin. A cretin! I've no doubt he is morally corrupt, but more offensive than that, he holds no regard for a man's heritage! Back in my day, the navy was where boys became men. Where well-bred Oriathans could earn their place among the elite, after a brief and relatively safe stint out at sea. Then Darnaw came along, and all of a sudden we have fellows from completely inconsequential families strutting around the cabins like they work there! Because they do! He lets them work there! Awful man, Darnaw. Just awful.
