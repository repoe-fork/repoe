Just the person I was looking for! And you even have my contract in hand. How fortuitous! I've spent a good long while thinking over our next move. There are many pieces in play, and we must act decisively if we are to enact the change I seek. We seek. The change WE seek. 

Here it is. We kill Darnaw. 

That's it. Brilliant, eh? We go to Darnaw's location, and we kill him. YOU kill him. You go to Darnaw's location and kill him. I'm going to stay here. Hands clean and all that. Couldn't be simpler!

Well, go on then!
