Admiral Darnaw's dead? Then you should be addressing me more formally! For I, Faustus, am the new Admiral! Well, I will be very soon. I'll send a small crew to investigate Captain Fidium's residence. I suspect they may find some damning evidence of Darnaw's corruption that must have pushed fastidious Fidium into a fit of fury! A quick keelhauling, and presto! No loose ends. We'll have to use my ship for the keelhauling of course. Fidium's keel is notoriously clean. 

Thanks to your hard work, I can now consolidate the Oriath navy under my banner. The largest military force, mine to control, sitting at the centre of all trade! 

I do believe this deserves a toast. To me! Long live the Admiral!
