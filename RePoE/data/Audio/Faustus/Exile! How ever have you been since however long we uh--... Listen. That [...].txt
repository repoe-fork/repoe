Exile! How ever have you been since however long we uh--... Listen. That little job you pulled for me went nowhere. I showed Darnaw the papers, and he had the gall, the GALL, to shrug! At me! He said 'What are you going to do, arrest me?'. I said 'I might!' And now I'm blackballed! No orders coming through from him, and no communications coming from any of the other surviving vessels.

I've a bit of a rivalry with another captain. Fidium. Clean as a whistle, Captain Fidium. Barnacles wouldn't stick to his hull. He's long had it out for me. Suspects me of underhanded dealings, the clever sod. I want you to break into his home and plant Darnaw's incriminating papers there. Put them where he's likely to find them. Probably a desk, or the latrine. Ehhhh... Desk. Let's go with the desk idea. He'll find the papers, confront Darnaw, and, WHAM! Sink two ships with one larger, stronger, handsomer ship.
