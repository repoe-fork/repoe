A fence like myself provides a thief like yourself the means to offload ill-gotten goods for something you'll find more useful; in this case, markers. I take those goods and sell them to the nobility for something I find more useful -- coin and prestige. As a captain in the Navy, it's not entirely unusual to confiscate illicit goods from pirates and smugglers, and the nobility happily reward me for retrieving their valuables from the hands of evil.

Sometimes I'll even return it pro-bono, if the owner's station may afford me certain privileges down the road. The job carries with it certain risks, but were a thief such as yourself to try to speak out against me, well, you'd only be incriminating yourself in the process. It'd be your word against mine. And who is a judge more likely to believe?
