Awful business, what happened to Oriath. Terrible. Just terrible. I was lucky. Safely out at sea with my crew. 

I hope those responsible are held accountable, barring those with whom I have ongoing business, of course. I suspect they were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Can't blame someone for having rotten luck!
