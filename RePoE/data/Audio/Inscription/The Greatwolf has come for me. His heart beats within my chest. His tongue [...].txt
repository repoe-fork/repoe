The Greatwolf has come for me. His heart beats within my chest. His tongue lolls within my mouth. His fangs crown my jaw. His eyes rest within my sockets.

I do not see Ezomyte and Eternal, king and commoner, master and slave. I see only prey.

In the world of street and field, the emperor has fallen. Those who were slaves are now free.

In the world of forest and mountain, the First Ones hunt and feed as they have done since the first dawn.

No longer will I walk among my people. I will not have their blood on my lips. I will not be their king.

I am the King of Wolves now.
