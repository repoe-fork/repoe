The Greatwolf has forced me to forget who I was... and has taught me to be so much more.

A man becomes a king so that he may protect the people of the day. A man becomes a god so that he may protect the people of all the days to come.

And so the endless hunt begins. 

The fervour of the First Ones remains, bound by the druids into fetishes of tooth and bone, skin and claw. I know where these potent talismans have been strewn. I have their scent.

And so the endless hunt begins.

I shall pursue the thieves of our ancient heritage. I shall wrest our First Ones from the clutching and the corrupted lest they feed and grow fecund on power not their own. Power I must have, must wield, in the name of all that is Ezomyr to come.

And so the endless hunt begins.
