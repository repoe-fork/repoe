I'm starting to believe that these growths have some sort of central... well, brain isn't exactly the right word, but it isn't far off.

These larger growths, these "blighted maps" you've found, they may lead us to the original source of the Blight.

Not long ago, I believed they were a symptom of Wraeclast's death. Fungal growths feeding on a rotting carcass. Now? I'm certain they're a parasite. Wraeclast isn't dead, but it is dying, weakened by its violent history, and being overpowered and smothered by the blight. 

God has laid out all the puzzle pieces. All we need to do now is put them together. I hope you're good at puzzles.
