See this growth? Not on me, you--... The fruiting body. The-... the big mushroom. Strange, is it not? Wouldn't expect something of this scale in a place like this. Stands out like a sin during a sermon. Unfortunately, this is one of many, and they're all filled with an extremely toxic fluid. Quite dangerous to one's health, and no one is paying any attention. No one but I, of course. That's why I've attached this purification pump to the gleba. The spore mass. ...The big yellow round part. 

I plan to pump the toxic fluids from the mycelium -- the rooty looking parts -- through the spore mass, robbing this growth of the fluids that allow it to thrive. Even if I can't find a use for it, at least it won't get into dangerous or clumsy hands.

In response, the mycelium is going to react. Violently. This is where you enter. 

My Mother Superior used to tell us that 'God helps those who help each other'. I'm dubious of the sort of help you might provide, as it has not escaped me that you are, for lack of a better term, drenched in viscera. Even so...

I've some devices we can deploy to help protect my purification pump here. When you're ready, start the pump, then choose a place along the mycelium to deploy a device. Then get yourself ready, as I expect there will be more viscera.
