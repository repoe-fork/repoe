Exile, I--... I can't believe it. We destroyed it. We destroyed the source of the blight! This may not cleanse Wraeclast immediately, but it is the turning point in the war against this foul rot. 

Growths are still out there, spreading and consuming and possessing, but without the beating black heart, it's simply a matter of time until Wraeclast is free once and for all. And it's all thanks to me.
