You've done well, my little apostle. Ahead of us lies the moment of truth. Where are you looking? I'm being metaphorical. We'll work on that.

Before we strike at the heart of the Blight, please make sure you're ready for what awaits us. This would be a very inconvenient time for you to die. I may even miss you. 

I suggest you limber up, because you're going to be doing some running.
