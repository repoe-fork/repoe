I'd be lying if I said my hands were clean of slavery's blood. I was a soldier. I went where Dominus ordered me to go. I sailed with the expedition to Ngamakanui, killed Karui warriors and rounded up Karui captives like every other bastard in a Templar uniform.

So I don't blame Lani for wanting to take back her freedom. And I don't blame her for believing Utula's lies either. I certainly swallowed enough of Dominus' falsities to sicken my soul.

It's what we do now that matters. I can see that Lani's heart is in the right place, and for once in my damned life, so is mine.
