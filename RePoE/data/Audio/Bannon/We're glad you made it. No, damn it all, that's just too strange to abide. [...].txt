We're glad you made it. No, damn it all, that's just too strange to abide. I'm glad you made it, and Innocence tells me I need to keep helping you. So that's what I'm going to do.

I know my way around weapons and armour, and all things Templar if you should want for further enlightenment on that subject. As for Innocence... I don't know. Sometimes he makes sense, other times... he's a shattered god, but he'll heal. I'll make sure of that.
