I fear I have not been entirely honest with you, my friend.

While it is true that this staff can forge a path for us through Kitava's Horns, it has the ability to revitalise Innocence into waking fully, and that is where the staff's true power resides.

In this act, I will become his host in the fullest sense, and together he and his brother Sin will be able to ally with you against the forces of darkness.

I bid you farewell, Exile, for where my spirit is set to travel, there is no return. Win this battle. Defeat Kitava. Free our people.
