I'm having a little trouble explaining it myself. I've never been the most devout of men, especially for a Templar. More of a soldier than a believer. But now? Innocence himself rests within me. His voice is weak, barely a whisper, yet still he has the power to keep us safe from Kitava's hunger... at least for now.

For my part, I'm simply grateful. Grateful that I have a god watching my back, and grateful that He's given me the power to watch others in return.
