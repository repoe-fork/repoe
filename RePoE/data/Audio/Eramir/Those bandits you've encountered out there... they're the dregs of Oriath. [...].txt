Those bandits you've encountered out there... they're the dregs of Oriath. And with any foul broth, the nastiest chunks bubble to the surface. 

The Lords of Larceny... Oak, Kraityn and Alira... the self-appointed monarchs of the forest. Thanks to you, Alira and Oak are no more, their brigand clans dead or scattered. Yet Kraityn remains in the East. And this village, this tribe... we continue to pay his taxes.

I would never venture to say that life in Wraeclast is easy, but with Kraityn gone... well, living here might just become possible.
