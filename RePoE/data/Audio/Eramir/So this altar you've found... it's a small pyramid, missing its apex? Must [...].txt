So this altar you've found... it's a small pyramid, missing its apex? Must be Vaal in origin. And there's only one artefact that I've ever laid eyes on that could be the missing apex.

Alira, Kraityn and Oak... they stayed with us for a short time, while recovering from the ordeals of the Siren Coast. Thick as thieves they were, until they discovered something: a small pyramid crafted in a Vaalish style. It had the power to enhance one's innate strengths. They fought over it, sundered the apex in trine... took a piece each, and fled.

If you're determined to unlock that altar, then I think your key lies with the Lords of Larceny.
