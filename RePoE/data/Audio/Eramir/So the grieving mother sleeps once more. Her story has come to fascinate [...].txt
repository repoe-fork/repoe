So the grieving mother sleeps once more. Her story has come to fascinate me, and your conquest of her makes for a satisfying dramatic climax, don't you think? I'm but an old man, living vicariously through your life. As history seems intent on repeating itself, I shall record it in a book, "A Historical Account Of The Goddess Gruthkul And The Legendary Champion Who Defeated Her." Yes, the title needs a bit of work, but it will suffice for now. Here, consider this offering as an advance on the royalties we shall reap post-publication... that is, if there is anyone in Wraeclast who can read.
