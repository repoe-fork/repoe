While they were highly advanced in their technology, the Vaal were rather brutish in their social practices. I find it rather baffling to think of the Vaal as a people who believed in science and progress and yet constructed elaborate sacrificial altars in the centers of their cities.

Judging by the construction of this particular ruin, I would say that the city rose to prominence during the reign of Queen Tetzlapokal who some scholars refer to as a 'waif of disturbing proclivities'. She was a devotee of Arakaali and according to the literature, had a deep fascination with mortality and the inert human form.

The histories tell how the queen would request her subjects to deposit the bodies of their deceased loved ones upon the steps of her palace. The corpses would be promptly taken inside to be used for... unfortunately most scholars fell into hysterical conjecture at that point. At least I hope it was conjecture.
