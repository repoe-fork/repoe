Yes, Ralakesh, the god of many faces. I read about this god when I looked after the museum in Theopolis. It's said he was obsessed with governance, in particular, the control of humanity through our base, animal instincts. He ruled over the citizens of one unfortunate Vaal city. Alas, the name escapes me.

Yet I do recall that his experiments brought his subjects to the brink of extinction and that he was forced to enslave many a primitive Azmerian of the time so as to repopulate his domain.

Though I shudder at the thought, I can only imagine that Ralakesh has rather similar plans now.
