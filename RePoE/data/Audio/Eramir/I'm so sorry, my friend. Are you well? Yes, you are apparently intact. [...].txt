I'm so sorry, my friend. Are you well? Yes, you are apparently intact. Remarkable considering... for the barest moment there you were something altogether different. I'm not afraid to admit it... a rather unnerving version of yourself.

If I were you I'd dispense with that artefact down the deepest, darkest hole that I could find.
