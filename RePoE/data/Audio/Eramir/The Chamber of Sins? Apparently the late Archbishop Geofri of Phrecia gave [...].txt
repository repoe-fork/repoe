I scoured fragments of documents brought back by Fairgraves - and Daresso, before his disgrace. I unearthed all I could on the Eternal Empire's masters and mistresses of thaumaturgy, a subject of keen interest to our supposedly devout High Templar.
 
If I were you, I'd avoid Maligaro's old laboratory. A place of illness infected by a diseased mind.
