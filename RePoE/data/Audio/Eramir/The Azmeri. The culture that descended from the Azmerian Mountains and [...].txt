The Azmeri. The culture that descended from the Azmerian Mountains and founded the Eternal Empire, so long ago. Not that these people have any understanding of their lineage. Their history, identity... all but destroyed in the cataclysm. 

These Azmeri took in a disowned son of Oriath, fed me, healed me. To repay my debt, I've taken in the orphans of a dead empire.
