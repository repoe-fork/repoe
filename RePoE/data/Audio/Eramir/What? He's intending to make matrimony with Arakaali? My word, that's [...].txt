What? He's intending to make matrimony with Arakaali? My word, that's quite a story even for Silk!

Yes, I know that name, and the place to which it is purportedly attached. A temple to the north, now in ruins. If Silk intends unholy congress with this Arakaali, that is the most likely place we would seek it.
