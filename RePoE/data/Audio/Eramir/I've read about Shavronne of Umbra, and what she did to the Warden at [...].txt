I've read about Shavronne of Umbra, and what she did to the Warden at Axiom. You did well to end Brutus' sorry existence.

But Shavronne's barricade, that's sad news indeed. There is little enough freedom in Wraeclast as it is, but to be stranded on that dismal coast... I pity the exiles to come.

Would I know how to lower the barricade? Afraid not. I was a bit distracted the last time I took the pass. Hungry goatmen to avoid on that side, Alira's thralls on this side.
