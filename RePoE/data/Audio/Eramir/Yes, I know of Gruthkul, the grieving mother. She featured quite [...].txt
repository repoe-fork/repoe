Yes, I know of Gruthkul, the grieving mother. She featured quite prominently in some of the Vaal texts I restored during my time at the museum in Theopolis. 

After the deaths of her children, Queen Gruthkul fled north, eventually finding respite amongst the refugee of her own shattered realm. Yet these loyalists saw their own queen as a weapon, a tool for vengeance. They nurtured her pain, transfiguring sorrow into hatred, hatred into violence. Like a grizzled bear, Gruthkul descended into animalism and ferocity. Yet her caretakers foolishly underestimated the agony their bereaved queen harboured in her heart. Like a bear caught in a trap, Gruthkul wrenched free of her human loyalties and slew her followers to the last woman and child. It was through devastation Gruthkul ascended to divinity. 

Gruthkul's pain has transcended ages and she will vent that pain upon any and all she encounters until her grief is finally laid to rest.
