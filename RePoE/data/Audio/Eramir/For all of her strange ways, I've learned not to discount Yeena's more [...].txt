As to this 'man-crafted' mountain she describes, I have seen only one structure of its like. Stumbled across sketches in the Theopolis archives, a piece of Vaal engineering, pyramidal in architecture. According to those documents the pyramid lies north of the Phrecian Forest, buried beneath the mantle upon which Sarn rests.

I have no idea whether it still exists, or ever existed for that matter. Still, considering the current circumstances, there isn't much to lose in the search, is there?
