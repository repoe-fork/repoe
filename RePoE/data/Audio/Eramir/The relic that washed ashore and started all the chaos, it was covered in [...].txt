The relic that washed ashore and started all the chaos, it was covered in ancient Vaal inscriptions. The symbols were much weathered, making them challenging to translate, yet I did my best.

The inscriptions spoke of the the god, Ralakesh. If this object somehow housed the spirit of that many faced monstrosity, then I fear we are all in danger. Ralakesh was renowned for his penchant for subjugation and control. Please, I urge you to destroy this god before his strength and dominance grow insurmountable. Nip this divine threat in the bud, as it were.

Now, it would seem that Alira has found herself rather consumed by Ralakesh's divine ego. At least her recent appearance and behaviour would suggest as much. If you could see to Alira's corporeal conclusion, Ralakesh will be forced to retreat into the relic. Destroy the relic and perhaps you will also destroy the god.
