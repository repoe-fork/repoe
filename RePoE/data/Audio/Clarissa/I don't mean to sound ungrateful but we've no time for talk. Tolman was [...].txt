I don't mean to sound ungrateful but we've no time for talk. Tolman was out here with me and now... you found him? Where?

Oh my God... Tolman.

This bracelet, I made it for him when he first arrived here. Idiot said he'd never take it off. I called him a liar. He didn't, though. Not once. 

I'll meet you back at the encampment, later... we'll talk some more then. Just for now, I need to be alone.
