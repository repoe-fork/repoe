Exile... you've helped me before. You can help me again, can't you?

The Ankh of Eternity. If the legends are correct, the Ankh has powers over life and death... when paired with the correct Azmerian ritual.

I've learned the ritual. All I need is the Ankh of Eternity and I know I can bring Tolman back.

Will you retrieve the artefact for us?
