No matter where you come from, or who you might be, we were all birthed by a mother. Our mothers protected us and gave us nourishment. It is our duty in life to honour that great task. Without a mother, none would tread this dirt today.

The most important commandment in our people's tradition is this: Honour the Mother, Honour the Life.
