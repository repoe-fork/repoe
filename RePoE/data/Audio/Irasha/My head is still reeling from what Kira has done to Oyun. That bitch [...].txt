My head is still reeling from what Kira has done to Oyun. That bitch looked at me day in and day out and proclaimed herself loyal unto death. She has shown her true face in the end. 

Once I thought the old gods were worthy of honour, and I can still see how one might think there are boons to be gained courting their favour, but if such favour comes at the price of Maraketh lives, then I spit on the old gods and Kira as well. May they all rot in the endless desert.
