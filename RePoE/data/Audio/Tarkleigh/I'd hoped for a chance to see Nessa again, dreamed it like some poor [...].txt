I'd hoped for a chance to see Nessa again, dreamed it like some poor bloody child believing in fairytales.

No, she's not one of us anymore, but at least she's not like Merveil either. Can't overlook a mercy like that. Who knows, perhaps Nessa is better off this way. Not like this is much of a home to come back to, anyway.

Look, I know you did what you could, and for that, you'll always have my thanks.
