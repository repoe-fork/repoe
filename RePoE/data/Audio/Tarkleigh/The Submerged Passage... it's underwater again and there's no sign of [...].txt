The Submerged Passage... it's underwater again and there's no sign of those shells you used to drain it.

Fortunately, there's another way to reach Axiom Prison and beyond, a path I scouted out myself, through what was once the Fetid Pool and then along the Ridge above it.

Problem is, whatever's brought those Karui revenants to life has also sealed the pool entranceway with a bloody great totem.
