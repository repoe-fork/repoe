The Ship Graveyard's blocked off? Dammit... that means that Brine King bastard knows you're coming after Nessa.
 
In that case, you'll have to pass through Prisoner's Gate, follow the mountains, and make your way back to the sea by way of Merveil's Caverns.
 
From the sound of it, Nessa's in no condition to venture far from the coast, so she has to be around there somewhere.
