You've seen Nessa? Talked to her? That's more than I had dared hope for, truth be told.

This... change... she's going through, this curse the so-called 'Brine King' has put on her... it can be broken. I know it!

You've got to keep going, follow her trail before it gets any colder. Make your way along the Coast, the Ship Graveyard, even Merveil's Cave if you must.

By my reckoning, this King's not the sort to venture far from his briny bed.
