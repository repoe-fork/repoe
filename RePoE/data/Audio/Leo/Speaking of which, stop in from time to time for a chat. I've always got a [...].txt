Speaking of which, stop in from time to time for a chat. I've always got a few events on the go. Exiles do love to bash each other... as if Wraeclast wasn't enough of a challenge for them!

But now and then, I like to streamline things. Make sure the ruckus has a bit of form and grace to it. Time your visit right, and I'll be able to point you in the direction of a right, top-notch ruckus.
