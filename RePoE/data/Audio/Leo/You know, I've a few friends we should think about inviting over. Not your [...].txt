You know, I've a few friends we should think about inviting over. Not your usual rank and file exile, all survivalism and vengeance. 

They're what I'd call your 'exile's exile', far more interested in beating the corruption out of each other than in taking on the twisted hordes out there.

A sensible coping strategy, if you ask me. And a damned fine philosophy for producing gladiators! 

Anyway, you just say the word. I'm sure they'll be thrilled to meet you.
