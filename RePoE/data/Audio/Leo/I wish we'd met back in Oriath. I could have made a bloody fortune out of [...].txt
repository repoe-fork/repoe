I wish we'd met back in Oriath. I could have made a bloody fortune out of you. Ah well, ancient history, that. Let's look to the present, and to keeping you from becoming ancient history yourself. 

I've met some mighty big hitters in my time, and picked up one valuable lesson from them: Don't get hit. A fighter can learn to take punishment. Body conditioning, armour, stamina... it all helps. But there are still attacks out there that'll cut through you like you're yesterday's bog paper. 

Best thing when one of those blows falls? Be somewhere else.
