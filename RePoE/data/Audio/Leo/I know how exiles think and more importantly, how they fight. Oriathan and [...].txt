I know how exiles think and more importantly, how they fight. Oriathan and Karui, brawler and thaumaturge, I've seen every type of combatant. I've recorded their strengths and nutted out their weaknesses. 

What do I do with all this know-how? I carve and hammer it into weapons and other bits and bobs. I could teach you a thing or two about that, if you're willing.

After all, if you're going to take down exiles, you'll need the right gear. Can't eat steak with a spoon, you know.
