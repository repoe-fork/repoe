You're getting quite a reputation for yourself in fighting circles. So here's another tip from the Redmane School of Not Dying, just to make sure you don't trip over your own pedestal. 

Some say you should focus on your strengths. That's good for the ego, not so good for keeping your throat unslit. Instead, drag your weaknesses kicking and screaming into the light, and give them a damned good looking-over. That'll help you protect your soft bits, but more importantly, it'll train your eye to spot weaknesses in others. 

Why go toe-to-toe with a man who has bigger toes than you, when it's his dodgy hamstring you should be going after?
