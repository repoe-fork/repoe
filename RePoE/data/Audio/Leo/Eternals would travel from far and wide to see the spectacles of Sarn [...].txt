Eternals would travel from far and wide to see the spectacles of Sarn Arena. The gemling diva Kalisa gave her final performance in there for Emperor Chitus himself.

Legend has it, on that same day, the first gemling legionnaire cut through four Ezomyte warriors in less time than it would've taken Kalisa to sing a single bar. 

It's seen more artists of war and of culture than any other place in the whole of Wraeclast.

Whatever becomes of this land, I'm going to make damned sure of one thing. Sarn Arena will continue to celebrate the spirit of glory. God knows, we all need a bit of glory in a place like this.
