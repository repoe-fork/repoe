It's the arena for you! Be honoured. That's not a suggestion, by the way. Be honoured. Sarn Arena is where everything and anything can happen. 

I never cease to be amazed by the spectacle when you throw a mixed bag of exiles into the old 'sand bucket'. An all day breakfast of free-range ruckus on toast. 

So get in there, and see how long you can take the heat. I'll be around to listen to your tales of woe when you're done.
