At this rate, we'll make quite the decent gladiator out of you.

That said, I'm bit concerned about your gear. It's one thing to have talent, but if you don't have the right gear, you'll be a talented corpse. 

Flasks are a must-have, especially the ones that can wash away any ailments an enemy might curse you with. The fastest, strongest fighter can be rendered as slow and soft as a slug. Thaumaturgy's a bugger like that. Choose your flasks wisely and use them sparingly. They've got to last you the whole fight, remember. 

Anyway, have a look at the bits and bobs I've mustered here. Every item hand-picked to make other exile's lives miserable. See if anything takes your fancy.
