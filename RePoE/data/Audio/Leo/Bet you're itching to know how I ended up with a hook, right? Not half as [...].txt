Bet you're itching to know how I ended up with a hook, right? Not half as much as my left hand itches in the middle of the night. The mind, eh? It's the damndest of things. 

But here it is. I got complacent. Been fighting in arenas and gutter pits so long I thought I knew it all. It took a waif of a girl with a rusty dirk to take my hand and my pride with one out-of-the-blue slash. 

So here's a bit of blood-earned wisdom for you. Life is a school from which you never graduate. Those who stop learning, start dying.
