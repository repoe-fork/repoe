Maramoa's given me the boot, you see. Oh, you didn't know about us? Not surprised. Pretty tight-lipped about her private life, that girl. Wouldn't mention anything to her, either, unless you're looking for a piece of axe. 

So, how about joining me, eh? I could do with the company and, as we all know, there's safety in numbers when it comes to living in Wraeclast.
