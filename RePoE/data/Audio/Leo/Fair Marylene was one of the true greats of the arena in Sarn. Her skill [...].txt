Fair Marylene was one of the true greats of the arena in Sarn. Her skill with a longsword was second to none. Pinpoint accuracy and fast as a viper. 

As the story goes, she started out as a gutter kid, brought up by her maidservant mother. No one knew for sure who her dad was, but some pegged Kre Faarblood as the most likely candidate. Apparently sowed more than his fair share of wild oats in his day. 

You know why she was called 'Fair' Marylene? She was a looker, by all accounts, but that wasn't how she earned the nickname. It was down to her fighting style. The girl was a dancer, so sure on her feet that she was bloody near untouchable. 

Could be something you want to try. Not the dancing bit, not literally, but working on your movement. Some fighters learn to take the hits, others learn to avoid them. Never seen a fighter successfully do both.
