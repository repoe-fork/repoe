Oh, you've been talking to the Hinekora Tribe, have you? They're very dramatic with the end of time fable. The Rongokurai Tribe has a much more dignified end in mind. When the world gets tired, it will be a quiet and calm slip into twilight, a night that goes on so long it blends into death itself. No more sunlight, no more plants, no more animals... no more people. Then, just as it always has, the sun will rise again on a new world. With sunlight comes plants, then animals... then people. It's obvious!
