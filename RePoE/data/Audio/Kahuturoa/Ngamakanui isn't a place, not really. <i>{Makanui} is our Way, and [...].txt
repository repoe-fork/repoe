Ngamakanui isn't a place, not really. <i>{Makanui} is our Way, and <i>{Nga} means 'from' or 'of.' So anywhere that our people go—mostly islands, we like to roam—that is Ngamakanui, because we have brought our Way to it. Outsiders that don't understand us often mark Ngamakanui in a particular place on a map, but that is a mistake we don't care to correct. It is better that the Vaal don't know where we are. Speaking of the Vaal, I haven't heard anything about them in a long time. I wonder how they're doing these days...
