Utula has the right idea. Why should we Karui listen to anyone who tells us what to do and how to live? We have such strength, yet we remain subservient. If I want to leave the Halls of the Dead and go to the Chambers of the Dishonoured, where they drink and carouse for eternity, why shouldn't I? Down with tyranny!
