I don't enjoy fighting all that much. I just happen to be very good at it. I was given this position because I kept winning. The others get very excited for every battle, but there are parts of the Halls of the Dead I wish I could see. Supposedly, there is a place for the souls of warriors that weren't very skilled, and there they laze around in 'dishonour' eating, drinking, and doing whatever they want. Where would you rather be, outsider?
