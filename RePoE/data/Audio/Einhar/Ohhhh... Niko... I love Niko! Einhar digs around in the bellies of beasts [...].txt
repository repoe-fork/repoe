Ohhhh... Niko... I love Niko! Einhar digs around in the bellies of beasts for signs from the First Ones, and Niko digs around in the ground with a big metal spike! And he talks to the First Ones just like I do. Or... I think he does. He talks to someone! And what a voice! He is very skinny though. I am not sure he will be a survivor.
