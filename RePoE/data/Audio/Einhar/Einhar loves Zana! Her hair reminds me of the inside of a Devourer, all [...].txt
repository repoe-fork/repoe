Einhar loves Zana! Her hair reminds me of the inside of a Devourer, all red and stringy. She says many things that I do not understand, and marks down locations of places I have never been, even though I have been everywhere! So mysterious! Einhar loves mystery and locations. She has not seen her father in a very long time, so I try to be her father. I try to feed her meat as red as her hair. "This will keep it red and stringy!" I say, and she tells me to close my eyes while she eats it. It is so red and stringy, it must be working!
