Einhar has a secret friend with a garden. Or is she a friend with a secret garden, hmm? Einhar loves secrets! I will tell you exactly where this garden is so that you can meet her! When I met her, I was dripping with juicy colours from eating her pets, but she was not angry with me. I was just in time to help her sacrifice many powerful beasts that refused to be good pets! Then I ate them, too.
