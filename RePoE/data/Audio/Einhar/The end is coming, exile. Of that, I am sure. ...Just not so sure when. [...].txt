The end is coming, exile. Of that, I am sure.

...Just not so sure when. Maybe tomorrow? Maybe three years from now. No more than three years from now. 

When the end arrives, we must be ready. The First Ones will return. They will bring the survivors with them to the Great Grove. We must prove we are worthy. We must sacrifice the beasts we find at the Blood Altar. 

Feed the altar the blood of these beasts, and the First Ones will bless us. And, perhaps, reveal to us their secrets.
