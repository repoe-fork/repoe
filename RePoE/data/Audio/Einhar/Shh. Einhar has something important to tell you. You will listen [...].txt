Shh. Einhar has something important to tell you. You will listen carefully, yes?

There are many rhoas here, but there is only one Oozeback Bloom. He is a mighty rhoa. Old. And strong. And dangerous. He reeks. He will make a fine gift for the First Ones.

Find Oozeback Bloom. Weaken him. Capture him. I will take him to the Menagerie. I will find a use for his back ooze. Maybe it is explosive. Maybe it is hallucinogenic.

Remember, Exile, a strong beast will escape. A weak beast may join our Menagerie.
