Welcome to Einhar's menagerie, exile. This is where I keep the beasts we capture. Do not worry about their wellbeing - I do not think they will worry about yours!! Haha! A little humour for you.

But seriously, exile, Einhar takes very good care of the beasts we capture. I feed them, clean them, and read them the poems I write. Then, when you are ready, we slaughter them at the blood altar, to prove to the First Ones that we are worthy of survival. That part is not so friendly to the beasts, but if you read my poetry, you may consider it an act of mercy. Hahaha! Again, humour! My poetry is great.

Please, look around! Take your time! But do not feed the animals. That is Einhar's job.
