There is a secret, Exile. A secret of this land. Einhar is not the one to tell it. You will have to ask my friend, if you can find her. She has a garden with many pretty colours. Before Einhar met her, I hunted her pets. The closer I hunted to her, the more there were, since they had escaped from her garden. Yes, for I know you are wondering, their meat was very juicy, Exile!
