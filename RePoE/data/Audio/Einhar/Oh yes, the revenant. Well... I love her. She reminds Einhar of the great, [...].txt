Oh yes, the revenant. Well... I love her. She reminds Einhar of the great, feathered Saqawal. I like to sneak up behind her as if she was Saqawal and I were Einhar, and I try to pounce like Einhar would pounce. Every time she steps out of the way and I fall on the ground like a silly Einhar! Even when I am as quiet as dead cat! How does she do it?
