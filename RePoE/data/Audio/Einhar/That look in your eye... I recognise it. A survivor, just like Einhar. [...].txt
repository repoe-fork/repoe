That look in your eye... I recognise it. A survivor, just like Einhar.

That is my name, exile. Einhar. In my native tongue it means 'lone fighter'. That is what Einhar was for many years.

But it is dangerous now to fight alone. Too dangerous, even for the mighty Einhar. We are in the final days of this world, exile. Of that, I am sure. We survivors must unite, prepare for the end, and delay its arrival as long as we can. 

For that we will need supplies. Weapons. Shelter. Food. 

The others here do not understand me the way you do. Meet me in the Riverways, and Einhar will explain what must be done.
