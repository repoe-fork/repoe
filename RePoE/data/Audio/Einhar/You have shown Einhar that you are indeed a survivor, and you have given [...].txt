You have shown Einhar that you are indeed a survivor, and you have given the First Ones their first gift. So now, a gift for you. 

I do not look like an artist, but I am an artist all the same. Look. When you catch a beast, Einhar will note it down. A little picture. Some words. When the world ends, we will need to have books. Information is needed to survive. To stave off the boredom and madness. To learn how to rebuild. You will help me fill it out, yes?
