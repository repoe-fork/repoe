The blackguard girl? Einhar hates blackguards... but I loooooove Helena! She is great at finding places to hide. I like to try to find her and then I hide and wait for her to find me! And she never can! Always I win! ...Now that I think about it, I do not think she knows to look for me. Maybe next time I should tell her before I hide.
