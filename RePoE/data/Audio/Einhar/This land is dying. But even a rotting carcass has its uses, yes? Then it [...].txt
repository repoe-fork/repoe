This land is dying. But even a rotting carcass has its uses, yes? 

Then it is settled. We will make rotting carcasses, and use them to produce the tools we will need to survive.

But only the finest rotting carcasses will do. Einhar is not picky, but I cannot say the same for the First Ones. There are a few beasts nearby, exile. Special beasts. We will find them. We will fight them. I will catch them. You will enjoy the fruits of my labour. We will be best friends!

Now, let's hunt. Together!
