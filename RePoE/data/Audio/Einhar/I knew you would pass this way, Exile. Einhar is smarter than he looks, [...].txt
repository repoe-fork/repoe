I knew you would pass this way, Exile. Einhar is smarter than he looks, yes?

There are more powerful beasts nearby. The Burning Menace. A hellion like no other. I will need a special cage for this one, maybe. She is surely explosive. I hope.

But there is another as well. Ungulath. Beware, survivor. It commands the very skies. 

These beasts make Oozeback look like Dryback. You will need special nets for these. Strong nets. Here. I have made them. Einhar is well prepared. 

Use these strong nets. Catch these strong beasts. Perform strong rituals. Gain strong blessings!
