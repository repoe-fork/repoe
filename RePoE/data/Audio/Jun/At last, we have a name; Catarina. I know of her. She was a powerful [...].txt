At last, we have a name; Catarina. I know of her. She was a powerful necromancer whose talents were... misdirected. I do not know for certain how she learned to raise the dead back to true life, but... I have my suspicions. And I have reason to believe that such power does not come without a great price. 

It is likely she is paying that price in very inhumane ways.

We must find out where she is hiding. Too much is at stake to let her continue.
