Exile, I want to show you something. I have been carefully tracking the Syndicate members we have encountered. Understanding how they interrelate will help us paint a picture of the rest of the organisation, and eventually, lead us to whoever is in charge.

I believe we can manipulate and take advantage of their relationships to bring us closer to the head of the Syndicate, and I have made this chart to keep track of all the details. I believe you will find it useful.
