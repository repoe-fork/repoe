I am so sorry, exile. It seems we have raised the ire of the Syndicate, and now they wish us dead. I too was attacked, and I sought you out as soon as I was safe, but I was too late. I brought this on us. I hope you can forgive me.

At least we can make the most of a bad situation... Every defeated Syndicate member is a new opportunity for information and manipulation.
