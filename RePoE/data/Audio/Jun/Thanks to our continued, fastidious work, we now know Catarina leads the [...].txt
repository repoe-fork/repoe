Thanks to our continued, fastidious work, we now know Catarina leads the Immortal Syndicate. We also know exactly where she is hiding.

Exile, we must defeat her, but we must be ready for anything. Catarina has not only an army at her disposal, but some of the most powerful artefacts ever known, including the Horns of Kulemak.

You must be prepared to face her. When you are ready, I will open a way.
