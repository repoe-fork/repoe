The picture is at last clear. Catarina has obtained the Horns of Kulemak, an artefact capable of shifting the very energies of life freely. She sought power, not just magical, but political power. To be able to grant immortality is a powerful bargaining tool indeed. 

Wraeclast is fractured. Many little societies separated by vast tracts of land. But it will not always be so, and Catarina knows this. She is playing the long game. She sees herself as an immortal Queen just biding her time. 

Her subordinates dare not cross her, for she has the power to gift them immortality, but also to take it away. 

There is a reason my Order hid the Horns for so long, and we are seeing it play out before our very eyes.
