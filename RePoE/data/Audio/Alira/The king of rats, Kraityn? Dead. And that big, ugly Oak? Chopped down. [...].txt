The king of rats, Kraityn? Dead. And that big, ugly Oak? Chopped down. You've made quite the impact around here. But I can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm.

Now, someone as resourceful as you would surely not have overlooked Oak's and Kraityn's amulets... the ones like mine here. There's power in those trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my friends and I safe.

Give me the amulets and I'll gladly make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.
