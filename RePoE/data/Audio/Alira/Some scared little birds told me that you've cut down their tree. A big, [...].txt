Some scared little birds told me that you've cut down their tree. A big, ugly Oak. Can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire.

The amulet I wear, sister to the one you took from Oak? Kraityn has its triplet. There's power in these trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe.

Go east, bring me an amulet, and Kraityn's lying tongue, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.
