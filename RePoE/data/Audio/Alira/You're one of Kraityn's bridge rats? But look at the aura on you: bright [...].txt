You're one of Kraityn's bridge rats? But look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion.

Kraityn's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets with you. No, he'll make sword grips out of your sun-dried entrails. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over.

Bring me a pair of the amulets, and Kraityn's and Oak's lying tongues, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.
