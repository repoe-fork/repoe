I caught some rats in my traps today. They told me an amusing tale: their rat king, Kraityn... dead. Can't say I'm surprised. You've a powerful aura on you... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire.

The amulet I wear, sister to the one you took from Kraityn? Oak has its triplet. There's power in these trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe.

Go north, bring me an amulet, and Oak's lying tongue, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.
