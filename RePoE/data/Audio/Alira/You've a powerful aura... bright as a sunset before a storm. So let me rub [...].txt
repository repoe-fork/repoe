You've a powerful aura... bright as a sunset before a storm. So let me rub an idea against that hot spirit of yours, see if it catches fire.

My little tribe has two problems. Oak in the North, and Kraityn in the East. They succeed in making our lives in Wraeclast even more miserable.

And then there's the matter of the amulets around their necks, the ones like mine here. <italic>{Stolen}. Taken when we three called each other 'friend'. There's power in those trinkets, enchantment enough to keep my tribe safe.

Bring me a pair of amulets, and a pair of lying tongues, and I'll make you part of that power. You need friends in Wraeclast, and believe me: I can be a fine friend.
