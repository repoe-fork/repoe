Some scared little birds told me you've cut down their tree. A big, ugly Oak. Quite a feat. And yet now you're one of Kraityn's bridge rats? Look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion.

Kraityn's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets with you. No, he'll make sword grips out of your sun-dried entrails. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over.

Bring me a pair of the amulets, and Kraityn's lying tongue, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.
