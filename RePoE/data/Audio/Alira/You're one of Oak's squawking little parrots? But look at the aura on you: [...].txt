You're one of Oak's squawking little parrots? But look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion.

Oak's no doubt spun you a line about sharing the power of the amulets. No, he'll crack your head like a walnut. Seen him do the likes a hundred times over.

Bring me a pair of amulets, and Oak's and Kraityn's lying tongues, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.
