I caught some rats in my traps today. They told me an amusing tale. Their rat king, Kraityn... dead. And yet now you're one of Oak's squawking little parrots? Look at the aura on you: bright as the sunset before a storm. Not the mana of a minion.

Oak's no doubt spun you a line about divvying up the power of the amulets between the two of you. No, He'll take the power for himself and crack your head open like a walnut. Seen him do likes of that a hundred times over.

Bring me a pair of amulets, and Oak's lying tongue, and I promise to make you part of that power. I believe in friendship, and I can be a fine friend to those who treat me sweetly.
