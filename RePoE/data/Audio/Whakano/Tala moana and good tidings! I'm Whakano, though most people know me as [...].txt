Tala moana and good tidings! I'm Whakano, though most people know me as the Barber. If you need a trim and tidy then take a seat. But a little fishy told me you may be more interested in a conversation than a cut.

A man like myself, travelling around as much as I do, hears a lot of things. Everyone needs their hair cut once in a while, and I am a very attentive listener.

Some of the things I hear could be very lucrative to people with certain, shall we say, unscrupulous ambitions. 

Drop a few markers in the tip jar, and I may accidentally drop some of my meticulously well-kept notes.
