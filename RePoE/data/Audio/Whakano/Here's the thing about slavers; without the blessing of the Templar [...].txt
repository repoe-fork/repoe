Here's the thing about slavers; without the blessing of the Templar authorities, they collapse under pressure like a sandcastle. 

My little fishies have come back, and they've brought with them a name: Friedrich Tarollo. 

Not surprised you haven't heard of him. He was small-time. But even in a career known for callousness and cruelty, Friedrich was a real bastard. Loved the chase. Loved the struggle. Left his mark on the backs of many of my brothers and sisters.

It seems he has holed himself up in a cave somewhere, declared himself the supreme ruler of the slavers, and is enjoying the lawlessness Oriath's collapse has brought to a sickening degree. Find him and bring him to justice.
