I heard the news, Exile. Tarollo is dead. The message is loud and clear to those who care to listen; the Karui are a free people, and will not bend to threats and terror, not now, not ever.

But what you found there... If Tarollo can use it to fuel his hate, maybe it can be used for protection. Yet... Just being near it unsettles me. I don't know what it is, but it needs to be in safe hands.

I'll hold onto it for now. I don't trust anyone else with it, not even you. Sorry... and, I suppose, thank you.
