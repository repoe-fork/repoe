Captains. I cannot speak for all Karui, but personally, I feel a great sadness for Oriath. Many people lost their lives, their homes, their families. Good people. Bad people too, but even bad people should have the opportunity to reflect on their misdeeds and change. Kitava took that opportunity away.
