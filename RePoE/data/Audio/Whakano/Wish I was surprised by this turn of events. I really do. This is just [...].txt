Wish I was surprised by this turn of events. I really do. This is just another line on a page, in a book writ only of atrocities against the Karui people. I fear this is not some aberrant event, but is the beginning of a pattern.

I appreciate your effort, though. I will stay vigilant. I hope you do, as well.

I will send a message to Hapihapi's friends and family. They will give him an honourable send-off.
