Heard you been doing some serious gardenin' around the place. Felled a big, dumb Oak, and plucked an Alira thistle from a foul bed.

And I'm thinking you got a couple of amulets in your pockets. Ones like mine here. There's power in them, you know. But only when all three get to dance together.

I'm not greedy, mind. I'm willing to split that power with you, right down the middle.

Hand me those amulets, and let's see what fate has in store for us.
