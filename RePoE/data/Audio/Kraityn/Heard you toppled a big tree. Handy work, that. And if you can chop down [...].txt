Heard you toppled a big tree. Handy work, that. And if you can chop down an Oak, you can pull out a weed. The weed's got a name: Alira, and I'm sick of seeing her in my garden.

What's in it for you? The amulets around Oak's and Alira's necks. The ones like mine here. There's power in them beyond reckoning.

I'm thinking you got one already from old lumber-for-brains. Make it two, bring them to me, and take half the power for yourself. That add up right for you?
