You're trouble. I like that. Know what I don't like? Oak and Alira, and their thieving mongrels. They keep taking what's mine. I'm thinking you could do something about that.

What's in it for you? The amulets around Oak's and Alira's necks. The ones like mine here. There's power in them beyond reckoning.

Take two heads and two amulets, bring them to me, and take half the power. That add up right for you?
