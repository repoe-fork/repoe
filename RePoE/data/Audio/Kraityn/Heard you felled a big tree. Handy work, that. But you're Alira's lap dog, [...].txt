Heard you felled a big tree. Handy work, that. But you're Alira's lap dog, are you? I could be wasting the last of my breath here... you're chasing the wrong tail. Once Alira's done with you, those brave guts of yours will be steaming on the ground.

You go take one head, bring me two amulets, and I'll give you half the power. That add up right to you?
