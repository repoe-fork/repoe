Few of us can say that we've devoted our lives to anything greater than ourselves. Can you? 

I think Utula can. Since the day I met him, I've seen Utula do nothing that wasn't in the service of his people.

He's a smart one. He could have escaped. He could have sailed off to Ngamakanui and never looked back. Yet there he stands, our herald of freedom. I might die of this wound, yet I'd be giving but a fraction of what Utula has to honour the Karui Way.
