The King's Feast is an ancient ritual born of less enlightened times. Long before the Karui followed the Way, one tribe would conquer another and a feast would be prepared for the triumphant King. The main dishes of this feast were selected carefully, for the sweetness of their nature and the tenderness of their flesh.

You see, when the conquered fills the belly of the conqueror, two tribes become one.

And that's what's happening out there in Theopolis, right now. The Tribe of Kitava is feeding upon the Tribe of Oriath, and the feast won't end until two tribes become one.
