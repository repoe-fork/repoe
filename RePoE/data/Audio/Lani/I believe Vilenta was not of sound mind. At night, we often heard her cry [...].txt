I believe Vilenta was not of sound mind. At night, we often heard her cry out in sleep, fearing unseen things. I wanted to toss her out on the streets, let the beasts of this fallen city tend to her madness, but Bannon refused to leave behind one of his own. Would that he had've listened to me...

Vilenta thought that if she gave us up to Kitava, the Ravenous One would look kindly upon her. Well, look upon her, he did, but what he saw and what she became is the thing of nightmares - her nightmares perhaps?
