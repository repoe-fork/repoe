Once Kitava has gobbled up every scrap of Oriathan flesh, sucked every Oriathan bone dry of marrow, he'll turn his endless hunger to Ngamakanui and the whole Karui Archipelago.

As you know, the Karui will fight, and they'll fight hard, but they're going to need all the help they can get. And I know of three treasures that might just make the difference.

They were taken when the Templar raided Ngamakanui. A whip woven of Hinekora's hair. A tooth that Tukohama ripped from his own mouth. A fish hook that was once the jawbone of Valako. Together they're known as 'Kitava's Torments' and lie within the Reliquary that borders Oriath Square. I saw them with my own eyes when delivering messages to the scholars there.

Please, go to the Reliquary and claim those treasures before Kitava's children do.
