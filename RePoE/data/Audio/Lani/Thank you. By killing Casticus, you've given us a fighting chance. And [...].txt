Thank you. By killing Casticus, you've given us a fighting chance. 

And about his eyes... I'm sorry you had to do that, yet although Utula's solution might seem brutal, I've seen Karui men blinded with a hot poker simply for looking a fraction too long at an Oriathan lady. Yes, this is war... and just a little revenge too. 

Take something, a token of our thanks.
