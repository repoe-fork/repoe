Remember what Utula said about Kitava? 

"He is the Tormented One, destined to rise up from the darkness... And we, his children, rise with him."

It was there all along, in eyes too bright and smiles too wide. Cunning concealed by kindness. Conquest wearing the mask of Freedom. I didn't see it because I was looking for something else. Hope.

The Cult only wanted what it's always wanted. To be born again in their father's image. They are Kitava's children, the first of his tribe. Unless you do something about it, they won't be the last.
