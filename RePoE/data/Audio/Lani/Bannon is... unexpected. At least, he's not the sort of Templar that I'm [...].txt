Bannon is... unexpected. At least, he's not the sort of Templar that I'm used to dealing with. His ideas about Innocence almost make sense to me. The way he worships Innocence, and receives such power in return, it's like his devotion actually brings out the best in his god.

But how is that possible? A god is a god. They bless us and they punish us, not the other way around. Yet for Bannon, somehow it's... different.
