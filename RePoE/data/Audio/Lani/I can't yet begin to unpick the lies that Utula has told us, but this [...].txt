I can't yet begin to unpick the lies that Utula has told us, but this piece of truth I do have. Utula sensed that very moment when you struck your final blow, when you broke the Templar's power. He turned to me and told me this. 

"Now our King comes to us. He'll be hungry, so very hungry. I shall prepare him a feast!" 

Then he gathered his followers and left. 

Where's he gone? Oriath Square. You won't need directions. Just follow the screams.
