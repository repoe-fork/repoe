By the light of Ramako, you did it! You, a mortal, have crossed the threshold between god and man and struck the ravenous one asunder!

I'd always held out hope that you would succeed, but at night, I would stay awake worrying that perhaps that hope was a foolish dream, but you've done it! You are no longer an Exile, my friend. I honour you, and I'm certain the rest of the world will honour you as well.

Please, I was saving this for something special, it's not much, but it's yours.
