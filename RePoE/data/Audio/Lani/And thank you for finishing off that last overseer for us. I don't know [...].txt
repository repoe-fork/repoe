And thank you for finishing off that last overseer for us. I don't know what sort of mother could've birthed that land-loving whale, but we were lucky he wasn't here when we took this tower. He'd have spread us across the floor like butter on a piece of bread.

Here, take something, for helping us in this hopeless fight of ours.
