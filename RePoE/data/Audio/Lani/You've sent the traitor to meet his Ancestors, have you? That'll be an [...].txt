You've sent the traitor to meet his Ancestors, have you? That'll be an interesting conversation. I'm no <i>{hatungo}, but I can foresee Utula walking a long road of trial and suffering before he earns himself a place at the Ancestors' table. 

And just as Utula's journey continues, so does yours, right into the jaws of Kitava.

I don't profess to understand the mind of a god, but I know the stories. Kitava is patient. He waited in the darkest pit of Hinekora's realm. He will bide his time while his hunger spreads like the plague it is, and when his tribe is replenished, a hundred times over, Kitava will rise one final time to finish the feast that he has started. Oriath is merely the appetiser. There's a whole world out there for Kitava to taste.

You've proved that you're a hero who can slay legends. Let's see if you can kill a god.
