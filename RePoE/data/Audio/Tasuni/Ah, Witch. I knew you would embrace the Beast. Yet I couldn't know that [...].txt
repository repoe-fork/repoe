Ah, Witch. I knew you would embrace the Beast. Yet I couldn't know that you would squeeze the very life from it. Honestly didn't think you had that much love in you.

Now one thing remains to be seen. Your regard, your touch, your embrace... can mean only doom for the loved. Please, choose your loves wisely, Witch, lest you break poor Oriath's heart.

Yes, that's right. Oriath. Upon the mountain high, a gateway has opened, one that shall lead you back home. Hurry, for as the death throes of the Beast soften and still, I see the gate beginning to close. 

Follow your heart, Witch, no matter how dark it becomes.
