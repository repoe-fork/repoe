You are a confusing creature, Duelist. Your heart beats for no one but yourself yet you have committed the greatest and most selfless of acts. Was it an act of the heart or merely... an act? 

Regardless, you may now stride heroically into the sunset, back to your grand arena.

Yes, in Oriath. Upon the mountain high, a gateway has opened, one that shall lead you back home. Hurry, for as the death throes of Beast soften and still, I see the gate beginning to close. 

Ever pursue your glory, Duelist, lest you be forgotten.
