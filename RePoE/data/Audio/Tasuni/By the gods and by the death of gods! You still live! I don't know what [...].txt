No, I mustn't enquire, for fear of losing my mind as well as my eyes... Oh, I am struck by a peculiar yearning, exile. It is as if I am a man stood on the precipice of a cliff, with an insatiable longing for the ground.

Please, leave me, before the frenzied voices inside my head devour my body and soul.
