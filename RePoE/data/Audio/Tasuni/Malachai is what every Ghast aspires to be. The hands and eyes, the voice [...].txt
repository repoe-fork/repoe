Malachai is what every Ghast aspires to be. The hands and eyes, the voice and mind of the Beast itself.

I see him in my dreams, forming his designs, crafting his tools, refining the chaos of nightmare into a vision. A future that you and I would not recognise.

That neither you or I belong to unless, of course, we choose to accept the dark embrace.

This is Malachai's greatest work. An act of invention like none other. Should he succeed, he will awaken the Beast.

What then? The Beast is not Death. Life will go on. A life like nothing we have seen before.
