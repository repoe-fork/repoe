My sister, Kira has grown obsessed with the Vulture of the Wastes, our goddess Garukhan. Kira has taken Oyun and plans to sacrifice her, imagining she can re-forge herself as a Red Sekhema, a warlord destined to unite the Maraketh under her bloody banner.

My sister's betrayal is too great for forgiveness. Like a rabid dog wandering the mountain pass, she must be put down. I ask this of you, for you are familiar with such barbarism and will not feel the pangs of mercy that I would.

On her person, I suspect you will find Oyun's royal mandate. The Sekhema Feather. If Kira truly wishes to take the throne, she would need such an item to be considered more than a simple usurper. Bring it to me for safekeeping.

And please, return our Sekhema Oyun to us, if you can... if she still lives, that is. But don't risk your life for hers. I know her mind. She would not want that.
