In the twisting, shifting black smoke of my dreaming, I saw the Beast, lying slain at your feet. I saw the rise of the old gods, their rigid, dusty remains, springing in sudden haste to life. I saw the growing of their power as the corruption began to fade.

I felt utter anguish, the madness of the Beast's last, rabid breath, yet my sight, my power, still remains. It would appear that I was permanently marked by its corruption, even as I was birthed from my mother's womb.

Well now my mother is no longer around to protect me, and the Beast lies rotting in the bowels of that wretched mountain.
