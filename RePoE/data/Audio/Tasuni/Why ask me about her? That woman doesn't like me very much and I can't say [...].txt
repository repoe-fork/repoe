Why ask me about her? That woman doesn't like me very much and I can't say I'm particularly fond of her either.

She seems to have gotten it into her head somehow that I'm the epitome of all evil - a selfish, blind villain. Nothing could be further from the truth - other than the blind part of course.

I suppose Irasha has good intentions - she truly wishes to see our tribe flourish, however she is too caught up in ancient traditions to see that for us to truly flourish, we must transcend tradition, we must become progressors of the future, not attendants to dry, dusty history.
