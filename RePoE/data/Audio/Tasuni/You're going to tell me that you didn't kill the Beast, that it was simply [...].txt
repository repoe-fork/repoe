You're going to tell me that you didn't kill the Beast, that it was simply your God acting through you. Please don't. I fear I might be ill upon your self-righteous toes.

No, Templar. You did this. The oh-so-ordinary man who shall be heralded as 'the chosen one' by the adoring sheep of Oriath.

Yes, Oriath. Upon the mountain high, a gateway has opened, one that shall lead you back to your flock. Hurry, for as the death throes of Beast soften and still, I see the gate beginning to close. 

Continue to believe in those lies, Templar. It brings out the best in you.
