For a lover of nature, Ranger, you surely know how to destroy it. Yes, you can argue, that the Beast was beyond nature, unnatural to its blackened core. I won't believe you though. It <i>{died} after all. Quite a natural thing to do, wouldn't you say?

Something to think about on your way back to Oriath, Ranger.

Yes, Oriath. Upon the mountain high, a gateway has opened, one that shall lead you back home. Hurry, for as the death throes of Beast soften and still, I see the gate beginning to close. 

Continue your wild ways, Ranger. They seem to come so... naturally.
