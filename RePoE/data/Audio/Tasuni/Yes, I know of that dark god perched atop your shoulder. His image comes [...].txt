Yes, I know of that dark god perched atop your shoulder. His image comes forth in my mind's eye, and I hear the sound of his breath crackle against the coldness of our mountain air.

He has a different energy to the other gods revealed in my dreams. Less hostile, more empathetic to the plight which humanity suffers... should his brethren be left to roam free.

It seems, Lord Sin, as if you are on our side.
