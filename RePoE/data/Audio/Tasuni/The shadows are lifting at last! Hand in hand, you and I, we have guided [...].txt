The shadows are lifting at last! Hand in hand, you and I, we have guided my people towards a brighter future. I suppose you wonder why I do not mourn? For my sister. For Oyun.

Why should I? There is no sense in shedding a tear for those who stand in the way of progress. They have passed from this coil, and that is the best thing either could have done for their people.

With our poor sekhema removed from her saddle, the way is clear. In lieu of a worthy leader, I shall step up, and with the backing of my followers, claim the throne of Highgate.

Irasha may spit and curse, yet her duty shall overcome her distaste. She will bow to the one who bears the feather as high custom dictates.
