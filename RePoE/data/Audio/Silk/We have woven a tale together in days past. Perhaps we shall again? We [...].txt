We have woven a tale together in days past. Perhaps we shall again? We make mighty stories, you and I, and now I have daunting task before me... the last in my great journey. 

Near to us, cast in shadow, a monster awaits. Black Death is his name, a beauteous eight-leg, twisted grotesque by the master of these loathsome halls. I wish to give this eight-leg the merciful peace he deserves, and to save what is still beautiful, the elixir that only Black Death can make.

Please, will you find him, kill this Black Death, take the eight-leg's venom for me? I may be fearsome warrior but Black Death's master has made him into a thing more monstrous than even I can best. Who knows? Perhaps Black Death is too strong even for you?
