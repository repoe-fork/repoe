The road? It runs east and west of here. To the west it passes the bandit woman's camp, then turns south, to the sea.

But you say it is now blocked? I have seen a strange thing in the rock by the south pass. Like one of Greust's carvings, but of stone. You should go look at it. What has been closed might be opened again.
