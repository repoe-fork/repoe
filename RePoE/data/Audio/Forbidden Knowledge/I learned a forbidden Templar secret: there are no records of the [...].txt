I learned a forbidden Templar secret: there are no records of the deceased. They are not 'hallowed, forever, together', like the priests told us as children. They are simply discarded, thrust away into crypts and buried haphazardly in the earth. The dead are simply... forgotten.

I wanted to be remembered, so I sought to become what they feared. I sought to live forever. I chased heresy and the unholy power of the demons... I raised the dead, and eventually, cheated death itself. It came at an inexorable cost â€“ and, as fate would have it, I paid with my life. Perhaps there is an irony in this.
