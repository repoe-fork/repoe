I vowed to "care for this empire with my eyes open". I lied to my people. I lied to myself. Blinded by my lust for 'purity', I placed my faith in the most corrupt of men.

I watch now as my legion dies, their flesh melting from their twisted bones. They fall... and rise. A tide of mortal death and eternal damnation.

I feel it now in my own flesh. The heat. The corruption.

I have failed you, my Empire of Purity. Do not forgive me but please, I beg of you, survive me.
