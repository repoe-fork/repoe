I'm fine. Sorry, I mean, hello. But, really, I'm fine. I don't need your help. 

...Wait. 

I... I do need your help. It's time to face reality. The wedding's off. Given our wildly different lifestyles, it no longer seems possible for my fiance and I to live happily ever after. Whakano has kept abreast of his movements, and, though he has remained faithful, he is... unhappy. I don't think it's because they have locked him up in an attempt to draw me out, but it couldn't have helped. I miss him dearly, and he misses me, but we cannot meet in person without jeopardising his safety or my freedom. He needs to move on, and so do I. 

I want to return our engagement ring. He'll understand. I cannot bear to do it myself, hence the contract. 

...Please?
