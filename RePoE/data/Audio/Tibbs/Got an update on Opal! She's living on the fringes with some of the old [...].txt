Got an update on Opal! She's living on the fringes with some of the old troupe, like I thought. Tough people to track down, but at least I know she's safe. 

I want to keep it that way. I want to make sure she doesn't need to put herself at risk to work or eat, so we're going to do what is, essentially, the opposite of a bank robbery. We're breaking in to leave enough wealth for her to live safely out of harm's way in a vault under a pseudonym.
