Ah, my contract! A man of my build gets a lot of attention. By the time I was thirteen, I was taller than most adults. By my next birthday I was invited to join a little circus of sorts as the strongman. That's where I met Tullina, by the way.

One day, someone left a baby girl, named Opal, for the troupe leader. She had bright red eyes, but the most pale skin and whitest hair I'd ever seen. She became a sort of daughter of the whole troupe. We took turns looking after her. 

By the time she was about seven, I'd grown quite attached to her, and she to me. The hardest part of being exiled is not knowing what has happened to her. So I want to find out. I know the troupe is disbanded, so I just want to make sure she's found a good home.
