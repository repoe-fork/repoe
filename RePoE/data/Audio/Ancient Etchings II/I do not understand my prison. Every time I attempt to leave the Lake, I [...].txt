I do not understand my prison. Every time I attempt to leave the Lake, I find myself instantly returning, as if I am making the choice to turn around and come back. In some cases, if I build up enough speed, I can make the transition take several minutes. Yet, I remember nothing of my time outside. Is this a real prison, or one whose walls reside only in my mind? What happens to me in those moments I cannot recall?
