<b>{Cafar of Beecham}

You have transgressed against your God and your fellow Man. You have been a willing vessel for the following Sins.

<b>{Unlawful Avarice}

<i>{One count of possessing stolen goods.}

<b>{Civil Envy}

<i>{One count of resisting Templar authority.}

God has charged me with your redemption. You are hereby Exiled to Wraeclast where, it is hoped, you shall come to repent your Sins, and make your peace with your beloved Father.
