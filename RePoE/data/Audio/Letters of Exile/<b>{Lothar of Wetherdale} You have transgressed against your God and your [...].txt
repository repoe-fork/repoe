You have transgressed against your God and your fellow Man. You have been a willing vessel for the following Sins.

<i>{Four counts of undermining Templar authority

One count of falsely defaming a Templar of Highest Reverence}

God has charged me with your redemption. You are hereby Exiled to Wraeclast where, it is hoped, you shall come to repent your Sins, and make your peace with your beloved Father.
