No, my friend. Merely confidence. The idea that one can see events yet to unfold is a flight of fancy akin to that of divine intervention, spontaneous generation, or medicine. We are born, we live, we get a small cut, we die, and we are gone. That is how it has always been, and that is how it will always be.
