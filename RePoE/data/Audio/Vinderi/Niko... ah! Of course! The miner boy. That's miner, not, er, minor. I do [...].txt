Niko... ah! Of course! The miner boy. That's miner, not, er, minor. I do believe he was of age when last I saw him. Strange lad. Always felt like he was talking at me, not to me, if you follow. Had an awful lot of yellow powder for sale. Wonder what ever happened to him? Lost track of many in that line of work. A shame, but not a surprise.
