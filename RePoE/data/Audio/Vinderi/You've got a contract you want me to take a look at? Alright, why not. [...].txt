...Oh! This was mine! Well, the designs have changed a bit, but the fundamentals are the same. It's a grocery list, except instead of the markets, we're going to an alchemy storehouse I'm not supposed to know exists.

So in that sense, it is very unlike a grocery list. Straightforward enough. Ready to go?
