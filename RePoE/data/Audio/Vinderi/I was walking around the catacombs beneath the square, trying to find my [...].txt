I was walking around the catacombs beneath the square, trying to find my way to the sewers under the courts. Had a huge sack of the blue stuff on my back. Leaving a little trail as I go so I can find my way out. Little azurite fuse trail winding its way back to the storehouse. Cost me an arm and a leg, that powder. Anyway, I'm right under where I thought the High Templar's office was. Start piling the powder up right under his fat arse. Planning to blow him back to Innocence. 

Well, I start hearing a hissing noise. And I start seeing the blue light down the end of the tunnel turning an angry red. It's moving towards me quick. And I'm thinking, this is it. This is where it ends for me, but at least I'll blow that high pain in the arse skyward. Then it stops. No hissing. No light. Just a silhouette. Tall as a man ever was. Taller than Tibbs. Don't know how he even got through the storehouse hole. This man... this glorious man! 

Put it down! He shouts. It's not worth the trouble. Come. It's time to go! So I put the bag down, and I start walking over to him. Running even. This man saved my life. I swear to myself I'll follow this Eternal Ideal of a man, this statue, this perfect specimen, as far as he will have me. And as I get close, my eyes adjust. This beautiful man comes into focus. His hand is extended to meet me. I reach out mine. There's an electricity between us. And as my fingers lock into his, he slaps a manacle around my wrist. I'm under arrest for attempted deicide and possession of a dangerous substance. Got me exiled, the pig. Once I got here I just started working for the boss.
