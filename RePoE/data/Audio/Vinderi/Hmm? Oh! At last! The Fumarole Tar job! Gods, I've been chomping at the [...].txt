Hmm? Oh! At last! The Fumarole Tar job! Gods, I've been chomping at the bit for this contract. 

I've drawn up plans for a bomb that, well, let's just say it'll put The Ring on the map. Or take it off the map. It might take quite a large area off the map, actually. 

I tend to deal with controlled explosions, but who doesn't love an uncontrolled explosion? Whoever's nearby, that's who! But other than them, they're great! And this is going to be really, really great.

There's only one place I know of that houses enough Fumarole Tar for the job, and it has all sorts of other experimental goodies that I'd like to get my hands on, too. 

Exile, this thing is really going to set your world on fire. I feel like a child again!
