Arr, as yer can see, finally found the missing powder in me shot-pouch - by that I mean me courage. Managed to make me way over to Lioneye's Watch to see me grandaughter finally. Tell yer, I don't know what in the blazes I was fretting about. She took to me like a fish to water and 'twas as if no time had passed at all.

Anyhow, it be lucky for you that we did so, as we were out looking fer ya, to offer our thanks. Followed me compass, listened to the thaumaturgical whisperings of me ship, next we know, we be following a trail of blood and guts, leading straight to you, wasting yer time in the middle of god-knows-where!
