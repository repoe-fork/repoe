So you're the shite that's gone and summoned me to the beacon, eh? Dammit all... rules is rules and now I'm bound to you, the legendary Weylam Roth, Captain of the Black Crest, cursed to be the undead slave of some lowly... outcast, by the looks of it.
 
You got an arse for a brain in that thick skull of yours? Of course I'll ferry you to the Brine King's bloody reef. I be wanting to discharge this accursed duty and get back to me afterlife. It's not right, not natural, being above water without a beating heart in me chest. 
 
So get yourself aboard and be quick about it!
