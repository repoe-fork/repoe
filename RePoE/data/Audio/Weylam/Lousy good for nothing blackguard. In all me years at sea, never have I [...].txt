Lousy good for nothing blackguard. In all me years at sea, never have I ever serviced a filthy blackguard on my lovely ship. If the Brine King still drew breath, I'd tell you having this Bannon aboard would be an affront to the lord of salt and scale... Him and his kind have hung drawn and quartered too many of ours. I don't rightly trust him. Not at all.
