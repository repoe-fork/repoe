I be missing me granddaughter something terrible. You know, I used to tell Lilly bedtime stories till she fell asleep in me arms. She loved the ones about Kishara, a tough-as-nails Vaal lassie said to have explored every coast, cove and bay of this blasted continent with the help of her Star, some nifty artefact she nabbed from somewhere on her first voyage. Young Lilly, she were fascinated by Kishara's Star. Said to be fair humming with thaumaturgy, able to guide its mistress wherever she be fixing to journey.
 
Methinks me granddaughter liked to imagine that one day she'd hold the Star in her hands and explore the outer reaches of this world. I'd dearly love to see her again, but there ain't no way I'm making that journey with nothing to show for it. She looks up to me, does Lilly. So I'm reckoning that Star might put a smile on her pretty face. With such a gift in hand, I'd maybe have the guts to go visit me granddaughter instead of skulking here like some craven ghost... that's if some kind and brave soul fetched it for me.
