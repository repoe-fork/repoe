Was a time where the ladies'd be begging for a bit of ol' Weylam. But I ain't felt the warm caress of a woman in a long time and it wounding me dreadful. During me time on the sea, I heard tale of Queen Atziri and her penchant fer using this land as a kinda vault for all her special shinies.

One such shiny be her famed love potion - s'posed to attract the drinker's ideal mate to their loins, even if that mate be far across the sea. Ol' Queen Atziri kept the liquid in the skull of her favourite lover.

Them damned Templars probably got their hands on it by now and the potion's bizarre container has me thinking they probably went and tossed it in the Ossuary along with the rest of the bones they got lying around.

Exile, be yer the friend I believe you to be, then find the potion for me, so that I can experience true love once more.
