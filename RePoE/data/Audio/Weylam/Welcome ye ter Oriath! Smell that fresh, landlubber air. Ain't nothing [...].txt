Welcome ye ter Oriath! Smell that fresh, landlubber air. Ain't nothing like the air in Theopolis, full of debauchery and pollution, hidden neath the garb of them holy templars... Seems the place has changed a fair bit since last I were here, a lot more blood and entrails than what I remember. Well, best Lilly and I stay here where it be safe. You journey on ahead matey, see what blimey buggers you get to kill next.
