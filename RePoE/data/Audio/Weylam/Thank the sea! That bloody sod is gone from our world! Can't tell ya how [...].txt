Thank the sea! That bloody sod is gone from our world! Can't tell ya how many times I've heard them Karui savages gibbering in fear over that cannibal god.

And of course, there's ah... all of this horror to account for as well. Aye, don't think there's a man, woman or child in the world that won't be praising yer name tonight over a glass of their finest grog.

Speaking of which, where's a man to go to find a little fire water around these parts?
