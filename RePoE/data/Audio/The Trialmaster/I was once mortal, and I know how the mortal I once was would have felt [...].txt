I was once mortal, and I know how the mortal I once was would have felt about certain things. That man would have hated Doryani with a passion for bringing about the fall of the greatest civilisation this world has ever known. Fortunately, I am no longer troubled by such attachments. Through the grace of Chaos, I now understand that all things that can happen, do. Even now I am testing the might of another survivor who washed up on Wraeclast instead of you, and to her, you are dead. All that you accomplish is meaningless. All that Doryani ruined was equally meaningless.
