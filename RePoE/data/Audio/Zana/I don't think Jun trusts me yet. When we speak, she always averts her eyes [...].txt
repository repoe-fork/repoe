I don't think Jun trusts me yet. When we speak, she always averts her eyes and keeps her sentences short, like she wants to leave. I've caught her staring at me too. I understand why she might be suspicious, especially given what she has been through, but... We need all the close friends we can get. We need to be able to trust each other!

What can I do to win her over?
