As a fellow explorer, I must admit admiration for Alva. Her motivations may not be as philanthropic as mine, but you can't deny that her methods get results. Do I wonder what kind of repercussions all her time travel is having on us? Of course! But we don't really know what the consequences of our travel through the Atlas are either, and I'm not interested in throwing stones while living in my own little glass house. 

I do wish she'd look past profits, but we've all benefited from her finds in one way or another.
