When I was a young girl I used to play with the neighbourhood stray cat, and one day it started bringing me mice. Einhar is that stray cat. Has he been trying to feed you raw meat too? I just don't have the heart to tell him how inedible it is. 

The first time he handed me a big raw steak, I began to cook it over the fire, and he told me I was 'ruining all the good red.' Since then, I've just hidden it when he isn't looking. Sometimes I open up a map and hurl it in there. I know how irresponsible it is, but... Einhar's a sweetheart. I don't need to see under the mask to know how deeply he feels emotions, and I can't bear to hurt him. 

Watch your step out there. You may land on some of my rotten scraps.
