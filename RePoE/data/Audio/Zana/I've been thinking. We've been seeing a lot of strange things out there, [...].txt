I've been thinking. We've been seeing a lot of strange things out there, and without a safe place to call home, it can all start to affect one's sanity. Your home here is... well, it's fine, but it never hurts to have options. 

I have a nice little place that's out of the way, with enough room for the both of us... maybe more. Interested?
