What did you discover, exile? Ah! The key to his private study back in Oriath! If what he said is true, then there must be some kind of weapon inside that can stop this "Elder". And stop it, we must. 

I know I ask more than you've signed on for, but this creature - we've both seen the effects it has had on the maps. The Decay it spreads... that it births from its victims. If that Decay were to reach out of the maps, as I'm certain is its intention, all the world would be lost to those malignant spores! 

Let us depart now, back to Theopolis and investigate this lead. Please, if there's decency in you exile, meet me there when you're ready and we shall begin to plot our attack.
