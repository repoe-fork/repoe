My home... Our home... It's... it's just... gone. After everything it has been through, I still thought Oriath could recover, could become the place I always hoped it would be... 

Now...? Now it's just ash. There's not even enough rubble left for us to scavenge through. 

Sirus, why did you have to--...?

I'm sorry, Exile. I should be happy. I should be thanking you for your help. I should be focused on the future. But I don't even know where to begin. Oriath, and the people who were in it, are scattered to the wind. We'll just... keep going, I suppose. What else can we do? Perhaps we can settle here... Stay in one place for a change.

But at least you're done now, right, Exile? You'll leave the Atlas alone... right?
