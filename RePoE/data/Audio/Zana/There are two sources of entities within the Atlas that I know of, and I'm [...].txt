There are two sources of entities within the Atlas that I know of, and I'm certain no one has entered from this side. 

Whatever that thing is, it has come from somewhere beyond the Atlas; some unknown parallel realm. It is entirely possible it has the same provenance as The Elder, though I desperately hope not. We simply don't have the tools to seal away another such creature.

Perhaps we're lucky. Perhaps we are too insignificant for it to take notice of us. We are on a small island of safety for the time being, but the waters are rising, and strange new things are beginning to wash ashore. Be careful, Exile. We know not what we are dealing with, and we should all fear the unknown.
