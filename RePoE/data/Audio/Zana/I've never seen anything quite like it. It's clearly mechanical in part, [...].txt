I've never seen anything quite like it. It's clearly mechanical in part, almost like the map device itself. But there's an energy that swirls within it that fills me with dread. It's reminiscent of The Elder, but there's something less malignant, less in-control about it.

I'd find some way to destroy it if I were you. The forces of the Atlas are not to be trifled with. They are beyond any reason or sense. They are chaotic, and you cannot expect to be able to wield chaos without it turning on you. I fear no good can come of this.
