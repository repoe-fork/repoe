I've spent far more time with far worse people than Einhar. He's eccentric, sure, but his actions come from a place of love. Well, not for his game, but for us. Yes, he keeps bringing me slabs of completely inedible animal flesh, and yes, he is loud enough to draw every fiend in a ten mile radius towards us, but you can be damned sure he'll stand and fight each and every fiend that comes running.

The meat I could do without.
