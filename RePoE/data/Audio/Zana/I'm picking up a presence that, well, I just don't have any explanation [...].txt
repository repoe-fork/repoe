I'm picking up a presence that, well, I just don't have any explanation for. It's not unlike that left in the wake of the Elderslayers, but it's... indistinct. I've tried to find a source, but it's as if it is concentrated one moment and everywhere the next. Just as I think I'm making progress, something changes. It's maddening.

I'm hoping you will have better luck. Look for something -- <i>{anything} -- out of the ordinary.
