If it weren't for the surprising accuracy of Navali's predictions in Wraeclast, I'd have thought she was as mad as the exiles in the Atlas. In my experience, anyone who claims to know the future is a few cogs short of a timepiece, or they're trying to trick you. 

I have to question her motives though... She claims to be an agent of Hinekora, and so far even the most benevolent of gods tend to cause utter chaos. Let alone a god of death...
