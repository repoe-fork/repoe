Good quality stone is scarce on this island. It's plentiful on Wraeclast, but shipping it back is slow, and those ships are put to better use bringing back survivors.

I know of a way that we might be able to source vast quantities of not just stone, but any resource you could possibly imagine. I just need to make sure it's safe.
