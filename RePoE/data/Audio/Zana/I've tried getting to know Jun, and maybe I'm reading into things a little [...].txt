I've tried getting to know Jun, and maybe I'm reading into things a little bit here, but I don't think she likes me. Whenever I try to talk to her, she gets quiet and averts her eyes. I've seen her fight, so I don't think she's exactly shy... and I catch her staring at me every so often. Long stares. The kind you do when you're lost in thought. 

I wonder what I did to offend her...

No matter! I'll just stay the course. I'm sure with a little more alone time we'll become fast friends.
