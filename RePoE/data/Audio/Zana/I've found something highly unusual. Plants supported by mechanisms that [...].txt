I've found something highly unusual. Plants supported by mechanisms that are remarkably similar in style to the kind employed by modern-day Oriathans. It seems someone has been carefully maintaining a crop of some kind, though not one likely to whet the appetite. 

Please investigate this strange garden, and be wary of its fruits.
