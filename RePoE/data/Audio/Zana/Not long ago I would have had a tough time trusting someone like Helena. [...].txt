Not long ago I would have had a tough time trusting someone like Helena. The training the Blackguards underwent borders on brainwashing, and it's tough to undo something like that. But I've learned that trust isn't about someone's past -- it's about someone's actions.

Helena's actions have gone a long way to prove just how trustworthy she is.
