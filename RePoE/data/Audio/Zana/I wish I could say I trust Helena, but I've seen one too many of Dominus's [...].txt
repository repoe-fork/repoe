I wish I could say I trust Helena, but I've seen one too many of Dominus's blackguards suddenly snap. The training and indoctrination they go through does not leave much room for one's own judgement. 

I'm not trying to sound ungracious. She's done a lot for us, but I'd be telling a fib if I claimed I didn't sleep with a blade beneath my pillow when she's around.
