I've seen men and women turn mad, but I've never seen a case like Niko... I think the ores and compounds he's been handling have been affecting his mind. He seems to be aware of it, too.

Can it really be called madness when it is of your own doing?

It's a shame. I'm sure we will encounter many subterranean environments where his expertise would be invaluable, but I simply can't risk our safety. The Atlas presents its own potential threats to sanity... putting additional pressure on Niko might send him right over the brink.
