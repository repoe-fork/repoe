I can't... I don't...

Exile, did you know? No, of course not. I don't think Venarius even knew who he was, how could you? But he knows now, and it seems he may remember many other things as well. 

If Venarius is capable of rewriting memories, he could plant very dangerous ideas into the minds of the vulnerable. We need to find those memories before he does. Don't worry, you're not alone in this. We are a team.
