Navali's powers are impressive, yes, but they are not without their limits. It seems her knowledge of things to come is restricted to our realm, however broad that may be. When it comes to the Atlas, her predictions don't seem as reliable. 

I wonder how much of this is due to the source of her powers... she claims to have been given the gift of second sight by the Karui goddess Hinekora, but since the gods returned I've heard nothing of Hinekora. Is Navali being misled by a deceptive entity? Or is Hinekora keeping a low profile? Perhaps the goddess simply has no interest in us, as she has her own flock to tend.

Regardless, it may be worth remembering that although Navali is a good friend to have, she has her own agenda like anyone else; an agenda she may have been given by her benefactor.
