Do you remember when we first met? The godslayer, so full of confidence... But I wasn't sure you'd make it out there.

I thought I knew everything I would ever need to know. I thought I was ready to go out and make the world my playground, but living amongst my father's books and papers prepared me no more than someone who spent years gazing out a window. Knowledge can only be tested when it is put to use.

Thank you for helping me test my knowledge. I have learnt just how much there is left to learn.
