Kirac blames me for Baran's affliction. Maybe he's right. I led these people into the Atlas. I put them in the path of The Elder. But he can't yet understand the importance of our mission - not really. He didn't see what the Elder was capable of. He doesn't know the fate worse than death that would have befallen our entire world were it not for our sacrifice. Were it not for... Sirus' sacrifice. Kirac will come around in time. Perhaps even Sirus will, as well.
