Sirus attempted to kill me, and were it not for Kirac's quick thinking and selflessness, he would have succeeded. That beam carried a unique type of disintegrating energy I still can't identify or heal... I don't know why Kirac did what he did, but just as he will remain forever scarred, I will remain forever grateful.

With Oriath now in ruins, it seems I'm off the hook in the eyes of the Citizen Vanguard as well. Perhaps Kirac vouched for me, or perhaps they simply have their hands full with other things. Either way, it's one small relief amongst a mountain of new worries... but it is something.
