How fares your mind? Everything still intact? Good. Then there's something I need to show you. I've spent some time out there, exploring the maps, and despite their apparent randomness, there are threads that connect them. Threads we should follow. 

The more we understand these connections, the more each of these maps can offer us, and the closer we'll be to finding out the secrets that twist them.

This is the Atlas of Worlds, and we can use it to track these connections; we can use it to chart a path.
