Kirac is fixated on saving Baran, and I can't blame him. I've been in his shoes. I know the desperation and powerlessness that comes from losing a loved one out there. It's why he works tirelessly to track the movements of the Elderslayers. It's why we keep plunging headlong into that mad place. For Kirac's sake, I hope we do save Baran.
