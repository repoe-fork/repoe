My father's memories litter this place, like the first leaves of autumn. They may very well be the last precious things I have from him. I've stored them for safe keeping in a Book Of Memories back in the Laboratory. That way, even if we fail in our quest, I shall always have a record of his last acts. Feel free to have a look through them, should you find yourself there.
