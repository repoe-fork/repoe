I'd like to keep my map device here, if you'll allow me. I found designs for it in my father's belongings and I spent much of my youth working on it. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I let it be damaged somehow. Of course, you are welcome to use it as much as you like. And, I think it would look rather fetching sitting here.
