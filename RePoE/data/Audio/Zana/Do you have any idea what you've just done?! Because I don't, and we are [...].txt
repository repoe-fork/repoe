Do you have any idea what you've just done?! Because I don't, and we are meant to be cooperating! 

How do you know this isn't some sort of scrying orb designed to allow that entity to peer into our realm, or even pass into it uncontested?

You're following in the footsteps of my father and Venarius when they released The Elder. 

I want to work with you, for the sake of Wraeclast's safety, but... I can't help but question your judgement right now.
