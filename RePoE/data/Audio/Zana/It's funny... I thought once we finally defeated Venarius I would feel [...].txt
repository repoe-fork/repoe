It's funny... I thought once we finally defeated Venarius I would feel happy... Instead I feel frustrated. Frustrated that a man like that was able to lead the Templar. Frustrated that he took my father from me. Frustrated that he released that entity into the Atlas... Frustrated that after all we've done, dangers still lurk out there. When will it stop, Exile? When will we finally be safe?
