I'm Rog. Gwennen said you'd be heading this way! Said you've got quite the moves. You're the kind of man that faces monsters with bravery and skill, are you? I prefer to avoid fighting, myself. This continent is fraught with danger. I specialise in logistics and planning, so I'm happy to support your fighting with my supply skills. Care to check out some of my deals?
