If Uhtred did not have the Triskelion Flame, then he was not a traitor. He performed many questionable acts, sure, but from what I can tell, they were done for the right reasons. I will send what you have gathered back to the homeland to ensure his name is honoured, not scorned.

Thank you, friend. You've illuminated a piece of our history... my history, in fact. I am descended from Owen, the son Uhtred sent back for safety. You've washed clean a black mark on our lineage. This may change the balance of power back home...
