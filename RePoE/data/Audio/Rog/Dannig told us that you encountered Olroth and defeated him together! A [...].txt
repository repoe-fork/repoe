Dannig told us that you encountered Olroth and defeated him together! A battle for the ages, no doubt!

However, I remain confused. If Uhtred didn't have the Triskelion Flame, then Olroth must have been the one to steal it. Dannig insists the Flame was not with Olroth, so... who took it? Who burned the boats and sailed away on that final fateful day? Something's off. I don't like this feeling, Exile. It leaves me with the ominous sense that there was someone—or <i>{something}—moving through these events without leaving a trail... it reminds me that we have but small scraps of the true picture, and that our history is only what we tell each other it is. We have not unearthed <i>{the} truth, merely <i>{a} truth, and I am left shaken and isolated from my forebears.

All we can do is carry on, my friend.
