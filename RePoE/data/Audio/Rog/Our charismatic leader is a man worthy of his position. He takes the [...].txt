Our charismatic leader is a man worthy of his position. He takes the front, the lead. I prefer to support things from a safe distance, and he, great man that he is, lets me do it. I've been on my fair share of quests and campaigns, and they keep trying to arm me and train me for fighting, telling me it was the only way I would find renown... but I aim to be the world's first famous supplymaster. That Rog, they'll say, he brought food and drink and equipment forth so promptly and so consistently, it amazed the warriors on both sides and helped win the day. Dannig tells me that this is a worthy dream to pursue. He's a good friend.
