I thought for a moment I knew that place... I cannot be sure, and now it is gone. Oh dear... Wait...! I think I remember seeing another one of these memories somewhere... Where was it? Oh dear. I don't remember. 

I must have a look around. It was around here somewhere... Or was it back in that cave? Was I in a cave? Hmm.
