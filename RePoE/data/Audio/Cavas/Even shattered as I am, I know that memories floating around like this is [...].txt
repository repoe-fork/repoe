Even shattered as I am, I know that memories floating around like this is not... normal. I believe something terrible has happened to me. 

What if other men fall victim? What if mothers forget their children? What if... what if the children are left alone and scared to fend for themselves in a world of nightmare... Exile, can you fathom the horror?
