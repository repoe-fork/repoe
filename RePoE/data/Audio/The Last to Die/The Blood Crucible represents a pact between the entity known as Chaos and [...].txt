The Blood Crucible represents a pact between the entity known as Chaos and the bloodlines of the High Priests of the Vaal, forged long ago in the height of the empire's madness. I am the last of the sole remaining bloodline, so if I die, the Crucible will cease to function. That is why you must continue on in my place.
