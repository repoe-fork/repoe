Deshret's banner flies at the Mines' entrance and now the darkness gapes, hungry and expectant.

Our Red Sekhema sealed that gate for a reason. Not simply to prevent the Beast from reaching out, but to hinder those fools who would disturb its slumber.

And here you are, about to be swallowed by that darkness. Let us hope the Beast doesn't notice your passing.
