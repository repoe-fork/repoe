The Old Man: Zana knows him. Grandfather? Mentor? Either way, he doesn't seem to recognise her. Impressive powers. Must be careful around him.


The Demon: Bad, bad, bad. No discernable motives. No discernable weaknesses. Completely silent. Need to be really, really careful around it. Probably better just to run.

Sirus: Quiet, but when he does speak, speaks with authority. Likes Zana? Definitely something going on there. 

Al-Hezmin: The greatest hunter alive.
