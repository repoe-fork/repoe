Now that we've a chance to talk without explosives and monsters around us... I'm Gwennen. Luck is my game. But it's no game. It's deadly serious. You have to believe you're going to win, or you won't. That's the nature of this life, understand? It is what you make of it. So when you gamble with me, know that it's your fault if you lose. You just didn't believe hard enough.
