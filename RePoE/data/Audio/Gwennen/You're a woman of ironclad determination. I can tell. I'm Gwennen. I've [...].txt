You're a woman of ironclad determination. I can tell. I'm Gwennen. I've got something I fervently believe in as well, but my religion is luck.  I've run headlong into danger because it was what <i>{I} wanted to do, any orders be damned, and I bet it's the same for you. When your actions and beliefs align, you can do anything. Even win at gambling. Which I bet you'll do. Care to try your luck?
