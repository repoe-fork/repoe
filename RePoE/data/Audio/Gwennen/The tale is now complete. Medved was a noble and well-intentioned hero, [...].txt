The tale is now complete. Medved was a noble and well-intentioned hero, but the darkness of Wraeclast corrupted him and turned him toward madness. Now that he has been put to rest, I am free. Once we find the Triskelion Flame, I can return home.

I must thank you for this. I am descended from Annest, the daughter that Medved sent away before the end, so his actions mark the honour of my lineage. When we return home, I will end the tale at his journey into the night to challenge evil's unseen leader. The Kalguur will know that he died in combat trying to save his people. The rest does not need to be told.
