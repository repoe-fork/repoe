I can recognise a man of faith on any continent. I'm Gwennen. I'm dedicated to a cause, like you, but my religion is luck. I've gotten through deadly situations I had no right surviving simply because I <i>{knew} I would. I assume it's the same for you and your prayers. This life is what we make of it. I bet I'm going to lose on our transactions, since you're going to pray while you gamble. I don't consider it cheating. I consider it admirable. We'll get on just fine.
