I am honour-bound to discover the fate of Medved and the Druids of the Broken Circle. They believed they could see into the future by peering into the past. Hypothetically, that's a power I'd very much like to have, for reasons of chance and profit... but I'm not sure I want it to be true. If Medved and his nature-mystics were right and Time truly is a circle, aren't we all doomed to repeat our lives over and over for eternity? If that is the truth, then there is no luck. No chance, no human will. All life is just a stageplay repeating over and over. I don't think I like that notion.
