Sun and Moon return to their rightful places, leaving our path now clear. Highgate lies ahead, Beast Slayer, and a debt that is long overdue. 

On this road, there are the goddesses of Maraketh to be reckoned with, and they will not take kindly to our endeavour. Regardless, I must enter the corpse of my beloved Beast and wrest our sliver of hope from the life you so blindly took. 

There is no prophecy nor portent, no epic nor allegory that can promise your survival in this great journey of ours. For despite your trappings, you remain most certainly, irrevocably, mortal.
