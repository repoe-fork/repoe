Despite your best efforts, Beast Slayer, a splinter of hope remains. The very seed that brought my Beast into existence. The Dark Ember.

Never again shall it birth a life so magnificent as the Beast, yet a residue of that power still lingers. Enough to give us a fighting chance against the ravenous Kitava.

How do we obtain this Dark Ember? Three hearts were silenced, three hearts must sing again, one last time. In that final flickering of life, our saviour seed shall be born. All I need are three fine souls with which to stoke the flames.

Shavronne of Umbra. Inquisitor Maligaro. Doedre the Darktongue. Three spirits of near unfathomable resilience and vigour, freed with the Beast's final exhalation. So let us begin the harvest!

Shavronne has come home, to Axiom. We shall give her the warm welcome she sincerely deserves.
