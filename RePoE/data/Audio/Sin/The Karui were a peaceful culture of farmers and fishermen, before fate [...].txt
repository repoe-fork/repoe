The Karui were a peaceful culture of farmers and fishermen, before fate thrust the great Tukohama upon them. It was he who put the stone axes in their hands and the hunger for conquest in their bellies.

Farmers quenched their dry fields in blood. Fishermen emptied their holds of fish and filled them with land-greedy hordes.

Battle by battle, war by war, Tukohama carved the steps that would carry him up a mountain of severed heads, and into immortality. Tukohama's axe is called Anger, his spear is called Greed, and their victims are the minds and hearts of all Karui.
