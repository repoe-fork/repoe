The Dark Ember remains nestled deep within the putrid flesh of my dead Beast. With many of Highgate's tunnels now collapsed, we must forge another way inside. Before us lies a weak point in the Beast's flank. It is an ancient wound wrought by that Vaalish overreacher, Doryani.

The wound was healed shut by a thick membrane but the right decoction should dissolve the tissue and allow us inside. Of course, for a cordial of such potency I shall require two ingredients of utmost rarity.

First, our viscous concoction shall require Basilisk Acid, a princely poison which drips from the caustic heart of the Basilisk, and Trarthan Powder, an explosive substance oft used in the mining of Virtue gems.

With these two bitter harvests, I shall brew something worthy of eroding the membrane of my decaying pet.
