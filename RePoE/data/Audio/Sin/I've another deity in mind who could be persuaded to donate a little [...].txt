I've another deity in mind who could be persuaded to donate a little essence to your ongoing edification.

Abberath, a deranged old goat with a thirst for human souls whose cloven hooves now stand astride the old prisoners road.

Have you ever tasted a soul, Beast Slayer? No, I imagine not. The poets all speak of sweet souls, bitter souls, enlightened souls and twisted souls. You know what most of them taste like, really? Regret, with a lingering aftertaste of 'should've known better'.
