Then it is as I feared. Kitava's strength has grown insurmountable in our absence, and his horns now deny us entry to his feeding trough. Evidently the hungry god has grown picky about what crumbs now travel towards his burgeoning throat...

It is this strength that concerns me. I have spoken with our friend Bannon over there, a wilful vessel of my misguided brother. I knew eventually we would need to enlist my brother's services, though I had hoped we need not do so this soon, yet it seems that we have no other choice.

We must invoke my dormant brother, slumbering within Bannon's frame. Kitava's horns are a thing of great corruption which only Innocence's purity can dispel.
