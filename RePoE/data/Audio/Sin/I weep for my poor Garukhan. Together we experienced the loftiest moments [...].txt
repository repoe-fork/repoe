I weep for my poor Garukhan. Together we experienced the loftiest moments that this world could offer.
 
Alas, it was my heavy heart that she could no longer bear. I knew her pride would one day be the storm that would ravage my precious humanity. In truth, it was for Garukhan that I sowed the Dark Ember within the depths of Highgate.
 
When love cannot be slain, it must be laid down to sleep.
