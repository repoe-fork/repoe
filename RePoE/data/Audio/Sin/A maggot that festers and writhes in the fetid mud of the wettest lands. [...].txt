A maggot that festers and writhes in the fetid mud of the wettest lands. Ryslatha, the white worm that corrupts the very earth while her heart yearns to replenish her slaughtered brood. 
 
Hers was a prolific tribe once, fat with peace and fecund with love. Then Tukohama's fire swept across her sacred land and her children were butchered by the madness of war.

Now the immortal mother has one waking thought. She will also ensure that her children are never harmed again. How? By making everyone's children, her children.
