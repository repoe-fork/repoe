It is good to see that you survived my friend, but then, you have fared far worse - the froth of a violent ocean should be no problem for you!

While we have been absent, Oriath has become a necropolis, aswarm with Kitava's wretched servants. The situation looks more dire than I had first anticipated.

Before we make our move, we must know what we are dealing with. I send you, exile, as a scout, as the only scout that would stand a chance moving through the shifting forms of this nightmare. You must discover where Kitava resides, only then can we issue our final blow.
