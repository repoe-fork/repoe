Lilly Roth is a noble... hm, how do you say it... scallywag?

I have witnessed the rise and fall of many great men and women over the aeons, and Lilly is well on her way to being amongst the very best of them. I suspect one day her name shall be sung in salty taverns the world around.

I must remember to keep on her good side now that she can see me. The beautiful pirate princess, hunting down the great god Sin would make for a fantastic tale, I'm sure, but one I would rather have remain in the pages of fiction.
