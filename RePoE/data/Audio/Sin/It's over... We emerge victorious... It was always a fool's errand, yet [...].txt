It's over... We emerge victorious... It was always a fool's errand, yet somehow, your courage has carried us through.

I congratulate you, my friend. Your world may have exiled you, but there will always be a place for you at my table. You have given humanity a fighting chance. Though darkness still covers the face of the earth, there is now a ray of light to pierce it. The insatiable appetite of Kitava has been ruined, and you, you are no exile! Why, you are a hero, worthy of praise. May your legend live on, into eternity.

Come, let us return to the others, they will be needing as many hands as possible for cleaning up this city...
