A renowned alchemist, eroded by his lust for distilled spirits - and not the alcoholic kind. Abberath the Scholar King, dancing upon a stage of chemicals and fire.

He used his knowledge to burn away the flesh so as to liquidate the life force within, a libation he consumed with both frequency and alacrity.

It started with animals, goats specifically, and thus his own cruelty became his curse. The Scholar King became the Cloven One, Quaffer of Souls. Some say he turned to the dram of Man in order to cure himself. I believe his thirst simply grew with his burgeoning immortality.

And perhaps he still retained some of his scholarly nature, for he seemed fair determined to share his hard won wisdom. He took himself a princess, a lovely thing from a local tribe, and nine months later she gave birth to something rather unlovely.

The Faun, as wild and wicked as the shaggy god himself. Schooled in his father's ways, the Faun would carry off many more virgins in his time, and thus, the race of goatmen found their footing.
