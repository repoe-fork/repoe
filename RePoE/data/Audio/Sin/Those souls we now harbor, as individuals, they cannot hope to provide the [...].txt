Those souls we now harbor, as individuals, they cannot hope to provide the onslaught of power that birthing our Dark Ember will require.

But together... together each soul shall shift and change, they shall be knit into one creature, filled with animosity. Our unholy union will excite the Beast, and bring forth our Dark Ember from its rotten womb.

You should steel yourself, dear friend, for once the cork is plucked from the bottle, the whole world will change.
