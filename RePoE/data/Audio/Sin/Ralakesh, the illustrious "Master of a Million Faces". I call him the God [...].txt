Ralakesh, the illustrious "Master of a Million Faces". I call him the God of Hide and Seek.
 
While other deities waged wars, spread their seed, and laid waste to whole empires, Ralakesh perched on his throne in a dark palace of ebony, choked with incense, blinded by obedience and deafened by a senseless cacophony of brass gongs.
 
Thankfully, he never had the courage to peek over the high walls he'd built, else the world might have been in trouble.
