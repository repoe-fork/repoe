Here we stand, amidst the coagulating remnants of my creation... Funny isn't it? Once I placed my Beast on a pedestal as my pride and joy, yet now I send you to breach the hull of my pet's fouling black core.

I have brewed for us a potion from the remnants of our harvesting hunt. I shall apply this fermentation to the weakened membrane and meet you within the black core where we shall further our agenda.
