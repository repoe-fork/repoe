Though we were worlds apart before, exile has brought us together. 

Back in Oriath, there were those that referred to me as the wonder child, but as you've likely discovered, titles mean little here. Wonder, Exile, monster, hero... it's not the name that defines you. It's what you do that makes you what you are in Wraeclast. 

Thank you. You have given me what matters most: the freedom to finish what I started.
