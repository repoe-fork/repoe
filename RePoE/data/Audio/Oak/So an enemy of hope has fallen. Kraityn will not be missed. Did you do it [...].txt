So an enemy of hope has fallen. Kraityn will not be missed. Did you do it for a higher purpose, perhaps? Something worthy... like peace?

Every day my brethren must battle and die with Alira's thralls of the old road. To spare the lives of many, you need take only one.

But if peace isn't enough reward for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Alira's worthless neck. I trust you have Kraityn's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.
