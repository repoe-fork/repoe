So Kraityn has fallen. A worthy achievement on your part. And yet you serve Alira? Not so worthy. You strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose than that. Something like... peace.

Every day my brethren must battle and die with Alira's enthralled wretches. To spare the lives of many, you need take only one.

But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Alira's worthless neck. I trust you have Kraityn's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.
