The halfwit and the whore are dead? I never thought I'd see the day.

Now I am king, unquestioned, unrivaled. A fine feeling indeed. Not much of a kingdom to speak of, but at least it's a peaceful one.

But if peace isn't reward enough for you, give me the amulets that Kraityn and Alira wore around their worthless necks. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to continue to do what we must.
