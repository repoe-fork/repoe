Alira sent you? But you strike me as someone who craves a higher purpose than that. Something worthy. Something like peace.

Every day my brethren battle and die with Kraityn's rats of the bridge, and Alira's thralls of the old road. To spare the lives of many, you need take only two.

But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulets that hang around Kraityn's and Alira's worthless necks. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.
