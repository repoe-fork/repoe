So an enemy of hope has fallen. Alira will not be missed. Did you do it for a higher purpose, perhaps? Something worthy... like peace?

Every day my brethren must battle and die with Kraityn's bridge rats. To save the lives of many, you need take only one.

But if peace isn't reward enough for you, bring me the amulet that hangs around Kraityn's worthless neck. I trust you have Alira's in hand already? I thought so. When joined with mine, those trinkets will forge us a new strength, you and I. The strength to bring about peace.
