Excellent. You have passed the gear check and appear to have a fishing rod. A rather nice one, too. Now you are ready to catch some of Wraeclast's finest fish.

The next step on your journey to becoming a Master Fisherman worthy of the Winding Pier is to actually catch some fish. Fishing is the simplest thing in the world. With your rod equipped, just approach a pool of water and cast away. It's really intuitive.

Soon, you'll find yourself overburdened with fish of various types. Before you rush off to trade your haul for a better rod though, bring me back a few of the choicest specimens to demonstrate your skill.
