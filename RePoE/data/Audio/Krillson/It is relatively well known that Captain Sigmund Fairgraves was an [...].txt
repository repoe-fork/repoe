It is relatively well known that Captain Sigmund Fairgraves was an explorer and sometimes a pirate.

What's less known is that Fairgraves was a whaler of some significance. This is interesting, of course, because whales make up only one percent of all sea life. When you catch one, however, it pays for all the rest of the fish in your net.
