Thousands of years before I was born, the Tukohama Tribe and the Ngamahu Tribe were in continual conflict. A cycle of vengeance kept the two groups raiding each other, and they were beginning to lose their superior positions. There was a danger of the other tribes becoming dominant. To put an end to it, Ngamahu and Tukohama went through the traditions together. Tukohama aided her in the forging of a legendary axe, while her ring, a sign of fire and fertility, was given to us. Eventually, her ring passed down to me. Kaom took it, and my head, when he slew me in his bid to unite the tribes. It is our Way, but my defeat still stings.
