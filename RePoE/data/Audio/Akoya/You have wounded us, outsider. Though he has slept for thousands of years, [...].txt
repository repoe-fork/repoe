You have wounded us, outsider. Though he has slept for thousands of years, Tukohama plays a very real role in our cultural and spiritual lives. He helped create the Way, and he set the Ngakuramakoi on the proper path. With the defeat of our god, my tribe will suffer a mark of shame and a spiritual restlessness that I cannot overstate. I understand why you did what you did, and I will try to remain fair to you, but I am not certain I can ever forgive what you've done.
