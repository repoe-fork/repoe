Like Ramako in stories, Ahuana is a ray of light in this dark place. The Halls of the Dead are a good thing, but the years keep passing, and weigh heavily on all of us. Kahuturoa was one of the first souls here, and I fear becoming like him. Right now, after only three centuries or so, I can still take the Way seriously and uphold all of our traditions with pride. What will I be like in thousands of years? With good friends like Ahuana remaining positive, perhaps I can make it to the end with my dignity.
