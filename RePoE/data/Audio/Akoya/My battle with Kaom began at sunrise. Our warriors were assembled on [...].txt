My battle with Kaom began at sunrise. Our warriors were assembled on either side, ready to slaughter each other, but neither of us gave the sign. By dawn's light, we fought on the sand, axe against axe. Kaom was strong, but arrogant, which showed through in his fighting style. When he overextended himself, I made him pay for it in blood. However, his greater strength kept me on the defensive. Every hour, the <i>{hatungo} called a truce, and we drank, ate, and were tended to. By nightfall, Kaom and I were moving like turtles, guarding ourselves behind our axes and taking only the most calculated movements. Eventually, he overextended again, and I dealt him a heavy wound to his chestâ€”but this was an acceptable sacrifice he had made on purpose. He broke my knee with the end of his axe handle, and that was it. He gave me a warrior's death, rather than leave me broken on the sands. I would not have had it any other way.
