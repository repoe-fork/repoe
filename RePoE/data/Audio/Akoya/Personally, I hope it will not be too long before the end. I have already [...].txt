Personally, I hope it will not be too long before the end. I have already existed three centuries longer than I was alive. Each tribe has its own belief about how the world will end, but you must understand, these tales do not conflict. They are all correct. Our traditional expectations are not literal.

Our <i>{hatungo} speaks of a time when all Ngakuramakoi will become so strong, and so skilled at warfare, that every man and woman will seek to become their own chieftain. Blood lust willl take over the people, and war will continue until only one warrior remains. That warrior will be the strongest that ever lived in all of history, and he will die soon after from his wounds. His fallen body will become the new world, and his blood, the rivers. His dying warcry will become the sky, and his fierce eyes will become the new Sun and Moon. Of course, this is not a literal tale. It is meant to give us a sense of place in a chaotic existence. There is immense value in this. Our traditions give us meaning and purpose, that is why I have dedicated my life—and my death—to upholding them. Otherwise, we would be adrift, and full of fear.
