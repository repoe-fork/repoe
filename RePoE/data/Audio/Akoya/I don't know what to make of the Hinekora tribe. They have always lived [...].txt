I don't know what to make of the Hinekora tribe. They have always lived halfway in death and halfway in life. Their eyes are elsewhere, and their words are meaningless. They have some kind of strength, but I don't know what to make of it, and I certainly don't feel they are passing down any wisdom to their descendants when they speak in riddles. Maybe it's just the particular warriors here? I can't imagine their children talking in prophecies and enigmas.
