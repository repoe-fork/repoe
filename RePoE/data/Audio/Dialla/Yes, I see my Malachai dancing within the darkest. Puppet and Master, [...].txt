Yes, I see my Malachai dancing within the darkest. Puppet and Master, power and bondage, cut the strings and the puppet falls. The show ends.

Before you cut the cords, my Not-a-Cockroach, tell my dearest Malachai that he has played his part most wonderfully.

Tell him that I love him, from the bottom of my hate.
