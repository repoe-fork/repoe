Malachai once said to me that those that hunt for love will never find it, and those that accept that they are love's prey are sure to be found... and devoured.

Of course, he had never met you, until now.

My Malachai is dead. I knew it, felt it, understood it the moment you struck the final blow. I am, I was... the Gemling Queen, and now my King is dead.
