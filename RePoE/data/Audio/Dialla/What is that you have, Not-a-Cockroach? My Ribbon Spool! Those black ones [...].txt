What is that you have, Not-a-Cockroach? My Ribbon Spool! Those black ones wanted them, my Ribbons. Wanted to wrap the city in black Ribbons.

Now they are <italic>{my} ribbons forever more. Forever more... I hate forever. I could tear 'happy ever after' from bards' bleeding tongues!

You're still here, Not-a-Cockroach? Oh, gratitude, yes. I should give you a token. Token... what token? This? Is this to your liking?
