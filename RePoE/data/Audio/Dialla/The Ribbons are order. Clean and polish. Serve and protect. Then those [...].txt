The Ribbons are order. Clean and polish. Serve and protect.

Then those cockroaches crawled in, swarmed through the cracks. The Ribbons' Spool is taken. <italic>{Stolen}. The black ones want them, my Ribbons. Want to wrap the city in black Ribbons.	

Find the Spool, Not-a-Cockroach. Look to my doorstep, where the Ribbons crush cockroaches yet. Bring the Spool, and I will find gratitude for you.
