How singularly remarkable you are, Not-a-Cockroach! Look at you, practically exuding a legendary nature. Easily the most wondrous thing I've seen in a long, long time. Not that I've seen a great deal, apart from the innards of this temple, this comfortable tomb... but I think you have proven yourself worthy, worthy of Malachai's crowning achievement: the Eternal Laboratory.

You are wise and fearless in <italic>{this} world, Not-a-Cockroach. Allow the Eternal Laboratory to return to you the gift of terrifying innocence.
