Baran: Prayer is the centre of his regimen. All other activities are flexible, including eating and sleeping, but prayer time never shifts. Bad knees.

Veritania: Insists on reading every night. Not sure where she got the books. Don't really care.
Talks in her sleep. Just noises, though - no discernible words.

Zana: Hiding something important. Not sure what yet. Probably related to what happened to the previous group. Keeps checking on us.

Drox: Loudmouth. Does weapon drills late into the night. Sometimes I hear him patrolling around the camp early in the morning. He must sleep, but I don't know when.
