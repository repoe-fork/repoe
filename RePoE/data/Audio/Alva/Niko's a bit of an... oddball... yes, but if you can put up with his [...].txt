Niko's a bit of an... oddball... yes, but if you can put up with his quirks, he's not without his uses. The mine he so passionately guards is simply filled to the brim with glittering goodies. I've been trying to cozy up to him in the hopes that when he hits the motherlode, I'll be right there next to him.
