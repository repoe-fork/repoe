Once, when I was digging through ruins in search of treasure, I came across a group of shrines. Horrific, ritualistic structures, shrouded in blood and darkness. I've seen monsters worshipping these things before, but this was different. The further I went into the ruin, the more elaborate and powerful these shrines seemed to be. If you ever see anything like that, tread carefully. The monsters there were unlike anything I've seen.
