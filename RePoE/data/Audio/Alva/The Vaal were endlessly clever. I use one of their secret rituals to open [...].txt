The Vaal were endlessly clever. I use one of their secret rituals to open portals to the past. That means, long ago, they were of course experimenting with that same kind of blood magic. Sometimes, they're back there waiting for me to accidentally open the other end of their portal, and they come charging out the moment I do! That's no problem for me, since I'm distantly of Vaalish descent, but they might not treat you so kindly, since you're... I mean, you know.
