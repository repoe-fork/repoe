I believe the secret of its location lies here in the Vaal City which, until very recently, was submerged and completely unreachable. It's a tale that beggars belief - some devil coated the land in darkness, but a hero banished it and raised the city from the riverbed! Then some bandits swept in, claiming invaluable artefacts and blocking the only entrance until an even mightier hero sent them packing. If they were around I'd ask them to help me achieve unfathomable wealth, but... you'll do I suppose.
