I've never met anyone as protective of their creations as Zana. It's not like her astrolabe thing can send us back in time... wait, can it? What does that thing do, anyway? I've seen the places it takes her. Some of them are truly horrifying! They make the Vaal look tame as kittens. Not Zana though... she's a lion with a kitten's face.
