I've not spoken to Navali about it yet, but I have to wonder how our little forays into the past affect her visions of the future. I also wonder why she isn't using that little power of hers to make us all unbelievably wealthy. Imagine all the Grand Arena matches we could bet on! I'd much rather watch some disemboweling than do the disemboweling myself, if it's all the same to her. I guess, when you really think about it, all that Vaal blood is on her conscience!
