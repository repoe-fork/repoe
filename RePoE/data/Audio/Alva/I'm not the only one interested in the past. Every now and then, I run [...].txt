I'm not the only one interested in the past. Every now and then, I run into an exile digging up history at my intended site. Sometimes, they've found something uniquely powerful, usually belonging to some ancient hero or champion. That's when I turn on the charm and make a new friend. You, on the other hand... in that situation, you should probably fight. No offence.
