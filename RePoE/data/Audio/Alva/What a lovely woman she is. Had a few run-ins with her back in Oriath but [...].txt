What a lovely woman she is. Had a few run-ins with her back in Oriath but I don't think she remembers... probably best, since I was hawking some forged heirlooms at the time, and she's got a knack for spotting forgeries. Now that I'm running an above-board operation - more or less - I'm looking forward to getting to know her.
