Not too long ago, I somehow managed to offend a powerful exile. Can you imagine that? Me, offending someone? They took it rather hard, and they had friends. They kept attacking my camp in greater and greater numbers, until eventually I was forced to abandon my dig and head home. Bullies. I'd like to see them try that with someone like you!
