Treasure hunting can be a dangerous business. On my fourth excursion into the Atlas, I encountered a trapped strongbox. A typical encounter, one would think. This one, though, released a formidable foe. The ringleader of the threats in the area had hidden himself in there! That wasn't the only trap, either. After that, I knew they were not just mindless monsters. They were actually trying to outsmart me... too bad for them, I'm a reliquarian extraordinaire!
