When I was young, my father gave me my first call to adventure by enlisting me in the employ of Dominus' navy. I used to love the sea. The way it smelled. The freshness of the air... but, some 'stuff' happened and I returned to Theopolis, intent on living a ladies life. Ha, it was not to be, obviously. 

My lust for excitement brought me to the Reliquarians - a secret society of treasure hunters, funded by those cold and greedy societal uppercrusts. I had my father pull some strings and before I knew it, I was amongst it all, raiding temples and tombs across the land. But, well... you're an exile, you know how the Templars are. Untrustworthy is one way to describe them. When I came across a manual of Vaal blood thaumaturgy, I knew I couldn't let it fall into their hands. And it never did. 

Though that damned High Templar knew I was keeping something secret... And so, no longer welcome amongst the nobility, here I am. Luckily there's a fortune to be made here and a few of my old clients still remain loyal to me when it comes to spending what they have inside their purses.
