So, you have found Hyrri's soul! Our <i>{hatungo} knows nothing of this Domain of Timeless Conflict, but it seems that we have a new realm to make war upon. We will find it and rescue Hyrri and her army, no matter the cost. Not a single Karui soul will be left behind. This is the promise I make to our Ancestors! We will have our vengeance!
