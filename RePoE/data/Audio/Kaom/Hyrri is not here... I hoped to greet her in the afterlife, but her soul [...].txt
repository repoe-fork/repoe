Hyrri is not here... I hoped to greet her in the afterlife, but her soul has not found its way to the Halls of the Dead. My tribe's <i>{hatungo}, Lavianga, believed that Hyrri damned herself by breaking the <i>{tavukai}, but that is not a rule the Ramako Tribe follows. I was certain there would be no dishonour in the eyes of the gods, yet Navali remains cryptic on her absence. She should be here. I am... incensed.
