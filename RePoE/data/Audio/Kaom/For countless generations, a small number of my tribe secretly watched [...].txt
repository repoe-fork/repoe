For countless generations, a small number of my tribe secretly watched over Ngamahu as she slept. She must have awoken by now, but I have heard nothing of her whereabouts or intent. It is frustrating having to remain here in the Halls of the Dead while the Mother of Fire walks the world in the flesh. I would very much like to meet her. Before I was of age, my father's father allowed me to look upon her sleeping face. It was only then that I understood that there are types of fire unknown to a mere boy.
