Let Wraeclast fester in darkness. It is a diseased land not fit for life. My advice to future generations of Karui shall always be so: keep to the islands and their abundance. Let the ruins of the Eternal and the Vaal Empires rot like the corpses they are. If Wraeclast needs anything, it is fire, to burn away that which can never be pure again.
