I have already proven that the Karui Way is the one true path. I united the otherwise squabbling tribes into one mighty horde, the greatest the world has ever known, and I did that with the sheer force of my axe. There are chieftains among us here that experienced that firsthand. They know not to challenge me. You should know that as well.
