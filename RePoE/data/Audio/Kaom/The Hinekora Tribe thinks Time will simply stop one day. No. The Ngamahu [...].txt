The Hinekora Tribe thinks Time will simply stop one day. No. The Ngamahu Tribe believes the world will end, not with some pathetic unraveling of the seasons, but with a tremendous eruption. Wraeclast will stab itself and pour forth its lifeblood to burn away all life, both the mighty and the diseased, as it has done before. Then, the first of a new line of Karui will emerge from the molten caldera, as we did before. They will be different. Maybe better, in some sense, having learned from the wisdom our souls will carry forward. Theirs will be a savage new world to conquer all over again. I wish I could be there to see it... a glorious new challenge unlike any other... but my soul will be returned to the volcano with all the others here in the Halls of the Dead, to be melted and reforged into that entirely new Karui essence, that new line. I could wish for no better end.
