I did hear that you 'defeated' Kitava. You should be aware that he was nothing more than a hungry blind child, propped up and fed by Utula's tribe. How exactly did you fear he would consume the whole world when he could hardly move from his cathedral cradle? Your great victory, 'Godslayer,' is nothing to brag about. We have not needed our gods to be personally present for thousands of years, and we will not be diminished by their loss. We have our own strength.
