My dream, my Nightmare, seemed without end. I couldn't think, couldn't hope, couldn't fight to escape. There was only madness and pain. I believed I had built a home and an empire for my people, but in truth, it was all a lie. You shattered my nightmare and slew Malachai, and for that, I have made no argument against your presence in this sacred place. Consider us even. I owe you nothing.
