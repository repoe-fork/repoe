This job is a bit... unorthodox. Do you recall the book I had you rehome? Well, its owner was quite fond of it. He took out a contract and, it seems, wants to negotiate for the book's return. 

I don't wish to involve The Boss in this, since the original contract was mine. I'm going to travel with you to meet the client to make sure there's no funny-business.
