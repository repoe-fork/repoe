Do I hear the clink of markers in your pockets? Claimed from one of your victims, or perhaps from the victim of one of your victims. It is impossible to know how far back that chain could unwind, but now they belong to you, and you seem to be in good health. To the victor, et cetera. It seems you are the one I have patiently waited for. Yes, you will do just fine. 

Take a marker in your hand. Speak these words into your mind: The Ring binds us all, and to all within I shall do no harm.

I will see you soon.
