Welcome, Exile, to the Ring. I am Kurai. While you are here, you will do no harm to any of its members. You are a guest of the Ring, and the Boss has no tolerance for guests who do not obey his rules. What goes around, comes around, if you will excuse the aphorism.

Take your time and look around. Introduce yourself to the others here. When you are ready, find me. The Ring has a job for you, if you are willing.
