You got the book. Some moisture damage, but otherwise it seems to be in good condition.

<italic>{To my Karui Queen,
The Ngamakanui rose has never been so beautiful
nor its thorns so deadly.
Let your aim never waver,
And your story ever be told.}

Thank you. I'll make sure it finds its way back to Ngamakanui, where it belongs.
