With the twins gone, their hold on civilian life is relinquished, at least for now. The increased business we will now receive is a simply a happy coincidence. 

And I know, somewhere in Hinekora's hallowed halls, Hana is sinking her claws deep into Vox flesh.

The Boss has authorised me to give you a bonus. Thank you again, Exile.
