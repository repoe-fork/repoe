A client wishes to utilise our services. The Boss would like to offer you the opportunity to assist member Karst on this job. There is room yet in the Ring, if you can handle the work. The details are on the contract. I suggest you review it before you set off.

Speak to Adiyah when you are ready. She will get you within range of the mark.  

And try to keep your partner safe, so he may do what he is best at. Karst is not as tough as he believes, but the Boss has never seen another Lockpick as talented.
