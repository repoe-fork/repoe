Death changes nothing, exile. Only philosophy, held true, alters the world. Here I say to you: the strongest should absorb the might of the weak and make it their own. For you, that means lettin' me live, so that I can maneuver within the organisation, stripping back the strength of others, making it my own. We do not stay dead, which means changing thoughts and minds is the only way you'll ever save the world from the Syndicate!
