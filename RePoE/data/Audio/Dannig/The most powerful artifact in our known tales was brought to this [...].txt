The most powerful artifact in our known tales was brought to this continent by the first expedition thousands of years ago. The songs tell of it incinerating evil, purifying tainted fields, and warding off those of ill intent. We could certainly use a relic like that now, in these troubled times... but to find it, we'll have to retrace the steps of those long ago souls. Only they can tell us the Triskelion Flame's unknown fate.
