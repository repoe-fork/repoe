The translation's tough on this one. This expedition's Remembrancer was clearly a novice. Prosaic lists of landmarks passed on the trek... notable hills, rivers, a mountain range... he goes on at great length about the battles, though. Pages and pages of arbalest bolts 'finding purchase in the necks and hearts of exotically dressed shamblers.' Young men were still the same bloodthirsty whelps thousands of years ago, it seems.

Might be a Vaal site from that description, though he doesn't go into detail about their clothing. The use of arbalests hints at Black Scythe work. There are a few locations that might fit the details from this logbook. What do you think?
