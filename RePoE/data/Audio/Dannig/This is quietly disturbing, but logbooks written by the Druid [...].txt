This is quietly disturbing, but logbooks written by the Druid Remembrancers often describe natural terrain by what it <i>{was}, as well as what it <i>{might one day be}. I find these logbooks the most accurate to the landscape we see today. They couldn't actually see the future by looking into the past, could they? They were simply experts on nature. Yes, science shrouded in mysticism... an excuse that reassures my soul. Shall we test their guesses, Exile?
