If I'm translating this logbook correctly, they seem to have met a tribe of... monkeys?... that could communicate with hand signs. They were capable of trade, and even had their own statues of deities unknown. I've been continually astounded by Wraeclast's wonders and dangers, but this one still seems a bit unbelievable to me. Shall we investigate this claim, Exile?
