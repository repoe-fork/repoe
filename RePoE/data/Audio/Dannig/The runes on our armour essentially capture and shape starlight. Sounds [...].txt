The runes on our armour essentially capture and shape starlight. Sounds poetic, but don't be fooled. The smiths of the Kalguur turned these runes towards killing work long ago, as soon as they discovered that they could compel arrows to find their mark and blades to bite deeper. The greatest smiths became known as artificers, and produced work of singular genius. There weren't many such relics, but there didn't need to be.
