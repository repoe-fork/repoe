I'm not sure I understand what I'm translating. At least one of the locations mentioned in this logbook belonged to a tribe of 'men of no name' who worshipped the bones of a specific kind of long-dead beast whose description makes no sense to me. Your continent is strange. Interested in exploring that area, Exile?
