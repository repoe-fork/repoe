Exhilarating! Enthralling! I journeyed into the night alone, a forbidden gem embedded in the pommel of my formerly useless sword. This time, I returned with the head of the Fiend, still grinning in final death, but now conquered. The gem blazed with the light of my fury, casting forth a beam of starlight that turned a missed slice into a cutting lethal blow.

We have been fools to deny this power. Too many of our people have suffered for this mistake. When the morning glow hits the treetops, I will command the surviving Knights of the Sun to search for more of the forbidden gems. It is time to conquer this land and make it safe for all time.
