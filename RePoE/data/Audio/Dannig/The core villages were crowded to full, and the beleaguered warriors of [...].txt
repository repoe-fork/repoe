The core villages were crowded to full, and the beleaguered warriors of the Knights of the Sun, the Black Scythe, and the Broken Circle had all drawn back. The starlight barrier did not retreat. Instead, it vanished. In haste, Vorana went to the Triskelion Flame's altar, but found it missing. The ships in the harbour had all been burned and sunk as well, save one, which had departed.

To the people, she shouted, "Uhtred the Traitor has taken the Flame!"

The people wailed in despair as the horrors closed in from all sides. Without the starlight barrier, there was no protection. The core villages became a fortress tomb, defended by wall and by iron, but inescapable. Many of us retreated to Olroth's resting place, only to find his glass case shattered. He has arisen, and we must believe he is out in the dark fighting to save us, no matter what Uhtred the Traitor claimed.
