In the final days of our people's history here, the Prime Remembrancer fled with the remaining survivors in a desperate bid to escape the coming doom. This is his logbook, Exile! Apparently, the Order of the Chalice found something... some unknown artifact... all he knew was that even the oldest men recognised its power and built a shrine around it.

It was to that shrine that Uhtred fled to escape Vorana's wrath. The survivors expected to meet him there, but the writing stops just short of the destination. Shall we retrace their steps?
