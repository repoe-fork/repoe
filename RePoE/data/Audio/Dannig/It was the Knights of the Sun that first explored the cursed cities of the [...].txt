It was the Knights of the Sun that first explored the cursed cities of the Vaal. This logbook was from those early days, right after they arrived on Wraeclast and found that empire glorious, shining... and filled with shamblers. I can't imagine what horrific event might have caused the death of an entire civilisation all at once. Not sure I want to know.
