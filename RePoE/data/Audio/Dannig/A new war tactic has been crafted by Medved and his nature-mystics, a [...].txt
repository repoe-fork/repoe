A new war tactic has been crafted by Medved and his nature-mystics, a strategy formerly forbidden by their beliefs. He observed the capability of the horrors here to rapidly grow and change, and he suggested that our mistake lay in the incompleteness of our task.

When we culled all but the hardiest of the twisted Vorniculia, the ones that remained spawned more of their ilk with inherited lethality.

Anything less only serves to draw ever tighter the vise of doom.
