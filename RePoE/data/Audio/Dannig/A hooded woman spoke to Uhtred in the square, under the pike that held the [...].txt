A hooded woman spoke to Uhtred in the square, under the pike that held the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend. "Why do you suppose your priests assaulted Olroth?"

Uhtred replied, "Why do you suppose Olroth was stealing into the darkness? He is the new leader of the twisted horrors. By day, he fights for us, and by night, for them."

The woman then lifted her hood and revealed herself as Vorana, leader of the Black Scythe. She replied, "For these words, I should kill you where you stand."

A scythe to his throat, Uhtred replied, "Kill me in one week if you wish it. If the enemy becomes disorganized and listless while Olroth lies in glass, then you will know the truth of my words."

Vorana promised, "I will feed you to the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend, here, if you are wrong."

Then she departed. The enemy did not become disorganized or listless that week, and Uhtred went into hiding at an ancient site of power.
