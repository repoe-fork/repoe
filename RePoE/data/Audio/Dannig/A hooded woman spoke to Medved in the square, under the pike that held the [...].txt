A hooded woman spoke to Medved in the square, under the pike that held the head of the Empty-Eyed Fiend. "Have you lost your faith, then, High Druid?"

Medved replied, "A man that does not study the past cannot escape repeating it, but a man that cannot study the past has no future at all. The Circle has been Broken."

The woman then lifted her hood and revealed herself as Vorana, leader of the Black Scythe. She replied, "Take up arms, then, and we shall fight our way across the gap between past and future."

Medved accepted her gift of two axes, and began training his order for battle. The two axes had gems fixed along the handles which offered tremendous power.
