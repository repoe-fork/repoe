They call me the first Herald of War, and indeed I was, but they don't understand. Valako gave a Sign to my people thousands of years ago, a ring with his graven pattern. It passed down from chieftain to chieftain in my tribe. When I put it on, it did something it never had before: it surged with the power of the storm. Valako didn't know me. How could he? The gods were asleep. So, I appointed <i>{myself} the Herald of War, and I used the power of Valako's Sign to win many great battles. I laid the foundations for Karui unification before Kaom was even an urge in some bastard's loins.
