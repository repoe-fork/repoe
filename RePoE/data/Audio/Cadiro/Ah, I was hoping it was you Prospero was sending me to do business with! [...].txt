Ah, I was hoping it was you Prospero was sending me to do business with! He only mentioned a Duelist, not that I would be getting the best of the best, Oriath's greatest showman! I made a fortune dealing in bets on you. Not on your fights, mind you, but on which noblewoman you would bed next, and when you might finally get yourself exiled. Consider me your biggest fan.
