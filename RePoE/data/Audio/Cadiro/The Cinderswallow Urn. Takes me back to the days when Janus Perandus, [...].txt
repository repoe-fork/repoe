The Cinderswallow Urn. Takes me back to the days when Janus Perandus, Chitus' great-grandson, joined the Order of the Djinn. Somehow, most of the Order ended up being dispatched, which allowed Catarina to pilfer the Horns of Kulemak from the Forbidden Vault. Catarina then used the Horns to resurrect the dead – without them becoming Undying – and established the Immortal Syndicate. Janus, of course, has joined the noble ranks of the Immortal Syndicate. I'm a little envious, truth be told.
