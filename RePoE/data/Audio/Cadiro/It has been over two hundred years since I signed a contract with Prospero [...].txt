It has been over two hundred years since I signed a contract with Prospero â€“ a deal which has prolonged my contented existence considerably. He was our household god, and our family paid homage to him in a tokenistic manner. It's one thing to make an offering here and there, or bat tithes in his general direction, but it's quite another to devote oneself utterly to his cause. I cannot imagine a life devoid of a partnership with him. Indeed, it would not exist. And I am all the happier for it... although it does come at a price.
