So you've polished off Izaro's 'Lord's Labyrinth' have you? Proved that you have the mettle for imperial leadership.

Sadly, the Empire isn't what it used to be, but you're more than welcome to knock it back into shape for us.

Despite my personal feelings surrounding Izaro Phrecius, he did provide we Perandus folk with an unprecedented opportunity.

Over the centuries, the Phrecius family had blocked our every attempt to gain the throne, on the scandalous basis that our blood was not of imperial quality.

So when Izaro called that whole blood fiasco into question with his Lord's Labyrinth, it gave us the only clear shot we would ever have at sovereignty.

Without Izaro, the Perandus name may never have come to be associated with the throne. So in a somewhat qualified fashion, he has my gratitude.
