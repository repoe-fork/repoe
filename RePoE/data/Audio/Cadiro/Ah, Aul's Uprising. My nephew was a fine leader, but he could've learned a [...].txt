Ah, Aul's Uprising. My nephew was a fine leader, but he could've learned a thing or two from Aul. It's said that Aul, the Crystal King, was once a slave who quarried stone, and he ascended to power predominantly through his leadership. He earned the respect of the people. Chitus could have worked harder to do the same.
