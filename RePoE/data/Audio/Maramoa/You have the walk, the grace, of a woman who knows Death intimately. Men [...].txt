You have the walk, the grace, of a woman who knows Death intimately. Men are born with that knowledge. We have to earn it. Yes, there's much that you and I might speak of but we have not the time now. Our youngest, Clarissa, went into the city to forage for supplies with her fool of a boyfriend, Tolman. They're overdue.

Will you help me, Ranger? Can you find Clarissa and Tolman before the Blackguards do?
