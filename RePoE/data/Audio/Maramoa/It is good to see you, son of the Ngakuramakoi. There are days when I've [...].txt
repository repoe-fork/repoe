It is good to see you, son of the Ngakuramakoi.

There are days when I've questioned the Ancestors. Why bring me here, to Wraeclast, so far from all that I love?

Seeing you vindicates their decision. It is easy to be Karui when you are surrounded by Karui, but to walk the Karui Way through the kingdom of Kitava, that is the true test of a warrior.

And as is our fate, our calling demands our sweat and our blood, every moment of every day. Our youngest, Clarissa, went into the city to forage for supplies with her fool of a boyfriend, Tolman. They're overdue.

Help me, cousin. Help me find Clarissa and Tolman before the Blackguards do.
