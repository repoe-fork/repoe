Maramoa Patua thanks you for returning our Clarissa to us. She is the gentle heart of this place, a spirit still capable of love in this wasteland of hatred.

Yet that gentle heart remains in jeopardy. Tolman isn't deserving of Clarissa, but she'll not smile until he's by her side.

You have the walk, the grace, of a woman who knows Death intimately. Men are born with that knowledge. We have to earn it. 

So from one woman to another, I ask for your help, Ranger. Please, find Tolman for us.
