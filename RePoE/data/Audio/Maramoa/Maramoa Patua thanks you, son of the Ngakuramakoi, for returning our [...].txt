Maramoa Patua thanks you, son of the Ngakuramakoi, for returning our Clarissa to us. She is the gentle heart of this place, a spirit still capable of love in this wasteland of hatred.

Yet that gentle heart remains in jeopardy. Tolman isn't deserving of Clarissa, but she'll not smile until he's by her side.

There are days when I've questioned the Ancestors. Why bring me here, to Wraeclast, so far from all that I love? 

Seeing you vindicates their decision. It is easy to be Karui when you are surrounded by Karui, but to walk the Karui Way through this accursed land, that is the true test of a warrior. 

And as is our fate, our calling demands our sweat and our blood, every moment of every day. Help us, cousin. Help us by finding Tolman.
