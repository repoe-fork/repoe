By the earth and sky, the power of the goddesses lies in your hands. Take these seeds and plant them in the fertile stone at their feet. From what I have learned, It is my hope that the orbs will force Solaris and Lunaris to grow limbs and flesh, to engage you in mortal battle. 

May this come to pass, and may you cut down these goddesses as a forester might fell a pair of stubborn old trees.
