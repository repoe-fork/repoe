I was out hunting food for our encampment. Like a prowling cat I was, but what I saw marching across the ruins made me feel like a little mouse.

Gem-studded warriors pounding the earth, lead by their strongest... a Captain. I've known of these gemling legionnaires, how they were once the personal swords of Emperor Chitus. But now they rise again, with this Captain at their fore. Swallowing my fear, I followed the Captain and found a force being gathered within the Grain Gate.

Exile, I know it's not fair for me to ask, you have done so many things for us, but if you were to find the Captain and slay him and his men, I would honour you greatly.

Our little town would not survive an onslaught such as the Captain is likely to enact upon us.
