These samples you've salvaged, though gruesome, hide within them countless secrets. Flesh and blood and bone and sinew, all but a veil, a mask that hides what truly drives us. I speak of the Intrinsic Darkness. The base desires and instincts that we all fight, yet rarely defeat. This Darkness hides within us, waiting for a moment of weakness -- a moment when it can take control. A cruel and invisible slave driver.

But we can coax it out... 

My master called it Sinner's Water. A concoction he spent much of his life perfecting. He would give it to his children and scribble notes as they beat me. In truth, I do not believe his concoction worked any more than his elixir of immortality, but that did not soften their blows.

His formula was wrong, but his idea was sound. My formula works, as you will see. 

Please, drop the samples in the jar, and ready your weapons. You are about to witness the darkness that drives us.
