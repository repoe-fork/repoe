What makes you, you, or me, me? Some say it is the soul, an intangible something that exists before we are born and carries on after death. But I have seen souls that walk the land here and show nothing that distinguishes them from the rats and the rhoas. 

It is something else. Something no man has discovered. A whisper. A flickering flame that burns through every inch of our being until it is extinguished. But what if we can capture it before it burns away? Bottle it up? Save it, and perhaps, even give it a new wick through which to burn once more?

You will find no shortage of ferocious beings near here. Kill them, cut from their flesh a sample, and bring the samples to me. We will discover the essence of being.
