How many innocent men and women can you think of who were exiled? We are here because we are violent, because we broke the laws of the land. 

I killed my master. I do not regret that he is dead, only that it was by my hand. My master was a sick man, with dark proclivities. A sickness of the mind that no alchemy could hope to cure. And he passed that sickness onto me. 

I was never violent until that day. Until that day, I could not fathom how one man could take the life of another. But Lucan drew out of me an anger I did not know I was capable of experiencing. It overcame me. Forced me out of my own body. And by the time I was in control again, my master was dead. 

That anger, that darkness is still in me, Exile. And that is why we are here.
