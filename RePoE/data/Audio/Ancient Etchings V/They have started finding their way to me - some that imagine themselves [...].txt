They have started finding their way to me - some that imagine themselves grand heroes, some that are simply peasants to a lord, all in their time of greatest despair and need. I cannot help them, yet we talk, and they leave here with a new direction, ignorant of the cost they will pay. My latest conversation has given me much to think about. The problem is one of image; of a likeness cast by faith, of a reflection drawn by belief.

What you need, my little thief, is a shattered mirror.
