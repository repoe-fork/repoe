Emperor Chitus was stabbed in the posterior by his own Lord Mayor on the eve of the Purity Rebellion. Chitus' grieving gemlings buried him in the Imperial Gardens and a plum tree was planted upon his resting place, so that his mourners might taste of his glory for years to come.

I found that tree, and one of my men tasted its fruit. I've never seen so much agony crammed into such a brief moment.

This... may seem a peculiar request but please, bring me one of Chitus' plums.
