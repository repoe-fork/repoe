My Allflame. My blessed, damned Allflame!

Oh, you want your moment in the firelight now, do you? Unfortunately, necessity is what it is, and for the Allflame to give life it must first be kindled <italic>{with} life. And since suitable kindling is in short supply around these parts, I have little option but to make do with what I have.

Namely, you.
