Now there's a familiar face! Before you say anything... yes, I did try to kill you. Inexcusable! I allowed pragmatism to overcome honour in a moment of desperation.

Please accept my deepest apologies and... what do you say? Can the two of us make a fresh start?

Marvellous!

Now, as you've clearly noticed, the Allflame has given me another respite from oblivion. Alas, it's a partial success only. I am neither man nor spirit, living nor dead. A state that comes with some rather frustrating restrictions.

I know we've only just been reacquainted but to put no finer point on it, I... I need your help.
