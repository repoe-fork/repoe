Miss making my swords, I do. Sometimes, I get pictures in my head from a long time ago. Making beautiful swords. Better than I can make now. Feels like a different man in those pictures. A smarter man. Quicker. Been collecting a few pieces here and there. Not like the ones I make, but still strong. Makes me think of home, makes me feel connected to that smarter man. You can have them if you promise you won't hurt me anymore.
