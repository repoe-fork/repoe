Tala moana, Marauder of Ngamakanui. No need to be surprised, Karui. My father and I were amongst those who tried to save your people from ignorance and damnation. My father paid for his arrogance with his life. I'm still paying for mine.

I'm Nessa. And I suppose I should thank you ridding us of Hillock, that putrid giant you felled out there.

Be careful in the days to come. Karui savagery is nothing when compared to the ferocity that is Wraeclast.
