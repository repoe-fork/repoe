I saw what you did to Hillock out there, Shadow. Your murderous art is the reason you're here, in exile... and it'll be the one thing that sees you through to another dawn.

I'm Nessa, and I suppose I should thank you for ridding us of the putrid giant. 

Back in Oriath, I feared your kind... condemned you from afar. In Wraeclast, I don't have that luxury.
