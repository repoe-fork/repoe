The tale of Brutus was a popular one in the schools of Theopolis, taught in the hopes of deterring students from ambitions not condoned by the Templar.

Brutus was Warden of Axiom Prison and one of the most feared men in the Eternal Empire. But there the histories end... and the myth begins, with Brutus commissioning a witch to transform him, in a mad attempt at immortality. A moment of hubris that didn't end well... for anyone.

If it's true then Brutus has my pity. Some of us pay too dearly for our mistakes.

Yet if you insist on learning from your own mistakes then please, take one of these. You might need it.
