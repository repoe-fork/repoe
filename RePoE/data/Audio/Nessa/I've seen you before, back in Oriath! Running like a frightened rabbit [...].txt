I've seen you before, back in Oriath! Running like a frightened rabbit from my father and his gameskeepers. Fleet as a fox you were, even with that leg of prize venison over your shoulder. And from what I saw you do to Hillock, you've grown even faster since then.

I'm Nessa, and I suppose I should thank you for ridding us of that putrid giant. 

I hope your speed never fails you, Ranger. It's all that stands between you and death, here in Wraeclast.
