Welcome to our home away from home... for what it's worth. I'm Nessa.

That putrid giant you just laid to rest? That was Hillock. You're lucky; he's eaten stronger exiles than you. Don't count on that luck lasting. It's in short supply here in Wraeclast.

Still, you've rid us of a curse, and we owe you our thanks.
